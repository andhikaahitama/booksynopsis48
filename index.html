He firmly believes that someone somewhere was looking after him during those four years. Examine the odds stacked against him and his readers will understand why he hold this view. During the conflict in Malaya and Singapore his regiment lost two thirds of its men. More than three hundred patients and staff in the Alexandra Military hospital were slaughtered by the Japanese &#x2013; he was the only known survivor. Twenty six percent of British soldiers slaving on the Burma Railway died. More than fifty men out of around six hundred died aboard the Aaska Maru and the Hakasan Maru. Many more did not manage to survive the harshest Japanese winter of 1944/45, the coldest in Japan since record began. John&#x2019;s experiences make for the most compelling and graphic reading. The courage, endurance and resilience of men like him never ceases to amaze.</p><p>John Lowry overcame the emotional aftermath of captivity to lead a full life. He is now retired and living in South London. About the Editor - Cecil Lowry has encouraged John to record his extraordinary experiences and has edited the transcript.

Reprint.</p><p>Grade 4-6-- Faced with a school assignment to write a letter to a famous person, Marty chooses to write to Napoleon Bonaparte. He has heard all about him from his grandfather, a lovable old coot. When the elderly man is forced into a nursing home, he tells Marty that one of the other residents can actually deliver the letter to Napoleon. Several weeks later, Marty astounds his classmates and teacher by receiving a letter, postmarked Paris, from the Emperor himself. The boy goes on to receive other missives from, for example, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Edison, and eventually comes to believe that his grandfather has pulled off an elaborate hoax. However, following the old man's death, a last letter arrives from Vincent Van Gogh, adding a bit ambiguity to the story. This unresolved element does not detract from the mystery, since most readers would be disappointed if the letters were the mere product of playful scheming. Throughout, a nice balance is maintained between the story's serious elements and the humorous, fantastic parts. The affectionate relationship between Marty and his grandfather is particularly well rendered. --Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>To the Many: Collected Early Works</h2><p>Transnational long before the term gained currency, Lola Ridge (1873-1941) was one of the most notable poets writing in America from the publication of her first book,<i> The Ghetto</i>, in 1918 until her death, inauspiciously, shortly before America&#x2019;s entry into the Second World War. Included are the complete texts of her first three books of poems, <i>The Ghetto, Sun-Up, </i>and <i>Red Flag,</i> as well as the never before published manuscript <i>Verses </i>(1905), the book of early poems she sought to publish in Australia before departing for America in 1907. With its publication, Lola Ridge&#x2019;s important place in the history of twentieth century poetry takes a significant step toward being recognized and restored.</p><p><b>Lola Ridge</b>, born Rose Emily Ridge (12 December 1873 Dublin &#x2013; 19 May 1941 Brooklyn) was an Irish-American anarchist poet and an influential editor of avant-garde, feminist, and Marxist publications. She is best remembered for her long poems and poetic sequences, published in numerous magazines and collected in five books of poetry. <b>Daniel Tobin</b> is the author of seven books of poems, <i>Where the World is Made</i> (University Press of New England, 1999),<i> Double Life</i> (Louisiana State University Press, 2004),<i> The Narrows</i> (Four Way Books, 2005), <i>Second Things</i> (Four Way Books, 2008), <i>Belated Heavens </i>(Four Way Books, 2010), <i>The Net </i>(Four Way Books, 2014), and <i>From Nothing</i> (Four Way Books, 2016). <i>The Narrows </i>was a featured book on Poetry Daily, as well as a finalist for the ForeWord Magazine Poetry Book Award.</p><h2>The Berghoff Cafï¿½ Cookbook: Berghoff Family Recipes for Simple, Satisfying Food</h2><p>Family is everything, and so is food when it comes to the Berghoff family. The Berghoff Cafe food and drink, originated by Herman Berghoff more than 110 years ago, is the foundation of Berghoff tradition carried on today by great-granddaughter Carlyn Berghoff. Cafe fare is simple and satisfying, nothing fancy, and not at all fussy. You can still enjoy this same kind of food today at Chicago's Berghoff Cafe, either downstairs on Adams Street or at O'Hare International Airport. <br><br>The cafe food is built upon three principles that work in the restaurant as well as at home: reuse, recycle, and reinvent. The Berghoffs reuse their basics and waste nothing, so potatoes become Mashed Potatoes, Lyonnaise Potatoes, hash browns, Potato Salad, oven-roasted potatoes, potato pancakes, Potato Soup, french fries, and Smoked Sausage and Potato Pizza. They also recycle perfectly wholesome cooked foods so Herb-Roasted Turkey Breast stars in the Turkey Reuben, but there's also enough left for the Turkey Okra and Rice Soup and more.<br><br>The eighty recipes plus variations in <i>The Berghoff Cafe Cookbook</i> represent the full range of Berghoff Cafe food. There are recipes from Great-grandfather Herman's cafe, updated for today's cook so they require less time and have fewer calories, alongside selections from today's cafe menu and customers' very favorite soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and desserts. The recipes you'll find in this book are easy to prepare, look great on the plate, and are a pleasure to eat.</p><p>Carlyn Berghoff McClure, CEO of the Berghoff Catering &amp; Restaurant Group, is the fourth generation to continue the Berghoff legacy of serving great food and entertaining guests. She is an author, a chef and restaurateur, a caterer, and a wife and mother. She is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and now operates out of Chicago's century-old Berghoff building, her base for off-premise catering. She also runs the restaurant, the bar, and the historic cafÃ©, and she is the coauthor of <i>"The Berghoff Family Cookbook"</i>. She has been married for fifteen years to Jim McClure, and the couple has two daughters and a son.Visitors to the Windy City almost inevitably flock for lunch or dinner to the Chicago Loop&#x2019;s century-old Berghoff Cafï¿½. Its warm, bustling, clubby atmosphere evokes nostalgia for bygone days of hearty eating and noisy drinking in the best German-American tradition. The Berghoff&#x2019;s menu has expanded over the decades, and it now serves some more sophisticated dishes. But the heart of its fare continues to be its popular soups, salads, and sandwiches. Cooks who want to reproduce their Berghoff favorites will find complete instructions here for doing so, even to baking their own pretzels or rye bread, part of whose secret turns out to be dill seed instead of more common caraway. Reinventions of classic fare include mustard-slathered sausage baked inside a crust, and popcorn-topped beer-cheese soup. Changing times have brought new dishes to the Berghoff, even pizza, here given a German accent with a topping of bratwurst and kraut. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>Ice Blonde (Angela Richman, Death Investigator)</h2><p>The last thing Chouteau County death investigator Angela Richman wants to do during the holidays is her job. So it&#x2019;s with some trepidation that she agrees to help the desperate Mr. and Mrs. LaRouche when they show up on her doorstep.<br><br>Their daughter Juliet is missing. She was last seen leaving a high school party just before midnight, and they&#x2019;d like Angela&#x2019;s help getting their trusted local detectives involved. The officer assigned to the case&#x2014;Chouteau newcomer Det. Jace Budewitz&#x2014;is far too blunt and impolite for their liking. And with the weather murderously cold, they can&#x2019;t bear the thought that their little princess is in the harsh winter wilderness.<br><br>Discreetly investigating Juliet&#x2019;s disappearance, Angela finds herself struggling to break through the silence from the rich teenagers who knew Juliet and their infuriatingly detached parents. She also discovers that their vicious bias against the local working class has cast a shadow over the case.<br><br>The more she digs, the less Angela can comprehend the lengths the one percent will go to protect their own. Angela must work quickly as she searches for answers with the acute awareness that Juliet LaRouche edges closer to becoming just a memory...</p><p>Elaine Viets has written 32 mysteries in four series: the bestselling Dead-End Job series with South Florida PI Helen Hawthorne, the cozy Josie Marcus Mystery Shopper mysteries, the dark Francesca Vierling mysteries, and the Angela Richman Death Investigator series.

When her every attempt to rekindle romance and affection with her husband--a prominent local doctor--fails, she finds herself turning to the friendship of Charlie Cobb, a new man in town. But as their relationship becomes more intimate, smalltown tongues start wagging, and their starcrossed affair leads to a shocking public murder.</p><p>Kip Gayden is a judge of the First Circuit Court in Nashville, Tennessee, where he attended Vanderbilt University Law School. This is his first novel."With MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE, Kip Gayden has accomplished what every historic fiction writer dreams he or she will be able to do. He has unlocked a forgotten crime and the lives around it and brings a lost time and place back to life. He holds us captive as his tale unfolds. MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE seems far more like the work of a seasoned writer than a judge with the ability to tell a good story." (<b>Robert Hicks, 'New York Times' bestselling author of 'The Widow of the South'</b> )<br><br>"A fascinating novel with a twist at the end." (<b>Nashville Bar Journal</b> <i><b>Marjorie Kaup Haines</b></i> )<br><br>"Sometimes true crime can lead to fascinating fiction. But who would have thought a sordid case in a small Tennessee town in 1913 would spawn an absorbing read?" (<b>Richmond Times Dispatch</b> )<br><br>"Judge Kip Gayden has written a wonderfully woven mixture of fact and fiction... . Judge Kip's well defined characters will engulf you deeper and deeper into its pages...so be forewarned that you will not be able to put this book down until its final page." (<b>Nashville.About.com</b> )<br><br>"If you're a fan of historical fiction and/or true crime--or if you're just in the mood for a really great read--I highly recommend this book. I would love to see more from Kip Gayden in the future."

Sir Roger FitzAlan is there by order of the King, commanded to build a mighty walled castle to defend England's borders. But the site the King has chosen has a strange circle of massive blue stones and when Sir Roger and his men arrive, a beautiful young woman is praying within the ancient circle. Even more arresting, the young woman flees from Roger's men astride a sleek black Arab stallion stolen from Roger's best friend nearly five years before. Roger gives chase and before long, the black Arab and Roger's mount leave his men-at-arms far behind. When the woman disappears into a thick wood, Roger follows her alone and quickly loses her. But someone else is in the deep woods, and that someone is intent on killing Roger.<p> Teleri of the Woods is delighted to have lost her pursuer and it isn't until the following day, when she returns to search for her lost pouch, that she discovers Roger, barely alive, and struggles to rescue him. Roger awakens in her bed, cranky, furious, and too ill to leave. Forced to remain with the beautiful young woman, he slowly becomes aware of the world about him in a way he has never known. Despite Teleri's lack of gold and possessions, she is rich in knowledge and appreciation of life. As Teleri teaches Roger about her life, he's forced to confront his lust for her and his prior beliefs about love. But their time together in the magic woods must come to an end and when it does, what will Roger do about the forbidden love that once ruled him?

William Pencak's research is extensive and the informative depth with which he addresses important political issues is unsurpassed. His analysis is unfailingly sophisticated and virtually unchallengeable. He paints with a broad stroke, putting his narrative and interpretations not only in a wide American context, but also in an international scope. . . . [A]n exceptional contribution to American Jewish history and colonial history in general."<br>-Frederic Cople Jaher, University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana<br><br>"Bill Pencak is no stranger either to novel topics or unconventional ideas. In this eminently readable and substantive contribution to the history of Jews in early America, Pencak has once again pushed the boundaries of debate in original and constructive ways."<br>---Edith Gelles, Stanford University<br><br>"William Pencak has produced a learned and informative volume on the nature of Jewish-Gentile relations in colonial America. The book's reconstruction of Jewish life in colonial New York, Newport, Charleston, Savannah, and Philadelphia is based on a broad array of primary and secondary source materials that persuasively demonstrate the fact that, despite a truly remarkable level of social acceptance, colonial Jews simultaneously encountered bouts of rejection. Scholars and general readers alike will be indebted to Dr. Pencak for deepening our understanding of the complex and often contradictory ways in which non-Jews related to their Jewish neighbors during this formative period in the nation's history."<br>---Dr. Gary P. Zola, Executive Director of The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives and Associate Professor of the American Jewish Experience at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion<br><i>Jews and Gentiles in Early America</i> offers a uniquely detailed picture of Jewish life from the mid-seventeenth century through the opening decades of the new republic.<br><br>Though the first national census in 1790 counted barely three thousand Jews, the Jewish community was nevertheless far more important in the history of early America than their numbers suggest, author William Pencak reveals in this fascinating chronicle of an often-overlooked aspect of American Jewish history.<br><br>Pencak approaches his topic from the perspective of early American, rather than strictly Jewish, history. Rich in colorful narrative and animated with scenes of early American life, <i>Jews and Gentiles in Early America</i> tells the story of the five communities-New York, Newport, Charleston, Savannah, and Philadelphia-where most of colonial America's small Jewish population lived. <br><br>How did these communities rise and fall? How did they interact with the larger gentile population? Pencak's exploration of popular anti-semitism in the pre-Revolutionary era describes the persistence of prejudices derived from traditional European society, and his abundantly detailed community studies explore the forms these prejudices took in colonial America, some of which continue to this day.<br></p><p>William Pencak is Professor of History at The Pennsylvania State University.</p><h2>The Remarkable Christmas of the Cobbler&#39;s Sons (Picture Puffins)</h2><p>A poor cobbler and his three sons worry about having food for their Christmas feast, until a playful goblin king pays them a visit, in a traditional Tyrolean folktale, illustrated by a Caldecott Medal-winning artist. Reprint.</p><p>Ages 5-8. First published in 1941, this Tyrolean folktale introduces the legend of King Laurin, who likes to surprise people on Christmas. Fritzl, Franzl, and Hansl, the young sons of a poor cobbler, could use a surprise. There is a war going on, and there is nothing to eat in the cobbler's cottage. On Christmas Eve, their papa is out looking for work when a visitor arrives. The odd little man demands food and a bed. There is no food, but there's a bed, and even though the brothers are sleeping in it, the rude, grumbly man demands the lion's share of the sleeping arrangement. Then he kicks the boys out altogether, but before they can get too cold, he magically sets them doing cartwheels, and, as they twirl, oranges and sweets and gold and silver fall out of their clothes. When their father returns, he tells them that they've been treated to a night of tricks and treasure by King Laurin. Sawyer's involving text is matched by Cooney's art, which not only is filled with charming details of alpine life, but also captures the mystery of the story. Traditional in both text and art, this should will easily find holiday fans. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Laurin, king of the goblins, ensures three boys a Christmas Eve they'll never forget in Sawyer's well-paced story. After their father, a poor widower cobbler travels into the village on Christmas Eve, the boys are visited by an odd, gruff little man. Although he's less than polite to his hesitant hosts, the stranger provides plenty of Christmas goodies for the family before he magically disappears. Cooney's paintings are steeped in old-world charm and her sandy, tow-headed boys are strong portraits of childlike innocence and wonder.

Though something of a rebel, he was also a brilliant leader, admired by the men in the platoon, which had been dubbed "Christian's Butchers." In due course, he was badly wounded and hospitalized, returned to combat and then was seriously burned by napalm. Returning to the U.S., he resumed his status as a warrior, this time fighting for Vietnam veterans' rights to education, job training and, above all, appreciation by their fellow citizens. Writing here with Hoffer ( Midnight Express ), Christian, now a business consultant, makes a strong case for the oft-maligned servicepeople who went to war in Vietnam simply because their government told them to--and his pleas for an understanding of what they have suffered will leave no reader indifferent. Photos. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Written with Hoffer, coauthor of Billy Hayes's story in Midnight Express (LJ 4/15/77), this book is an account of Christian, the "Victor Six" of the title, and his unit during the Vietnam War. Utilizing unorthodox tactics, the unit successfully met the enemy time and again in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia. Wounded in action, Christian returned to the war only to be severely burned by napalm. This ended one war for him, and he returned home to wage another. While completing his college education and undergoing 33 operations for his wounds, Christian became an outspoken champion for veterans; in fact, he lost his veterans' affairs job with the Carter administration after a much-publicized speech. His book should appeal to the popular audience which is apparently its target.<br><i>- George F. Scheck, Naval Underwater Systems Ctr.

Libussa von Krockow, a member of the old German aristocracy, had to fight not only to save her family and newborn child from the invading Soviets and later the Poles but also against traditional Prussian male domination. When she and her parents abandoned their ancestral home to escape the invading Soviets, her stepfather's initial reaction was to kill himself and his family. Libussa refused to submit to his will, and her course changed her role as a traditional woman. She kept the family alive by stealing, by rescuing her stepfather from a Polish jail, and by leading the family on a harrowing trip to the West. With her husband dead, she defied her stepfather and sought employment with the Allies.

Eisenbaum&#x2019;s work in <i>Paul Was Not a Christian </i>&nbsp;will have a profound impact on the way many Christians approach evangelism and how to better follow Jesus&#x2019;s&#x2014;and Paul&#x2019;s&#x2014;teachings on how to live faithfully today.<b><i></i></b></p></p><p><p><em>Paul Was Not a Christian</em> is a groundbreaking work that systematically overturns both scholarly and popular conceptions held by Christians and Jews, liberals and conservatives alike. As Eisenbaum reveals, Paul is not the true founder of Christianity as is often claimed, nor does Paul understand Jesus Christ as having superseded the Torah and thereby replacing Judaism with Christianity. Although Paul unabashedly proclaimed his faith in Jesus, such proclamations were not inherently "Christian," since no such religious category existed in Paul's time.

Lady Alice Lisle was the last remaining link with the hated regicides, the men who signed Charles I&#39;s death warrant, and when she gave shelter to a clergyman who had been involved in the popular uprising known as Monmouth&#39;s Rebellion, Judge Jeffreys, the &#39;Hanging Judge&#39;, showed no mercy. &#34;The Regicide&#39;s Widow&#34; recreates a disturbing period of British history through the characters of Lady Alice Lisle and Judge Jeffreys, a period when fairness, justice and truth were cast aside in the interests of political power and conformity. It is a truly Machiavellian story of statecraft, with government and judiciary involved in a ruthless display of might. In the end this display worked against them, for while it did not lead to direct revolt, the effects were so harsh and memories so vivid that the people of the West were among the most energetic supporters of the Glorious Revolution which three years after the Bloody Assize brought James&#39; rule to an end.</p><p>Antony Whitaker OBE is a barrister and was for many years legal manager of Times Newspapers Ltd.

Through the telling of his life story, Jaworski posits that a real leader sets the stage on which &#34;&#34;predictable miracles, &#34;&#34; seemingly synchronistic in nature, can - and do - occur. He shows that this capacity has more to do with our being - our total orientation of character and consciousness - than with what we do. Leadership, he explains, is about creating - day by day - a domain in which human beings continually deepen their understanding of reality and are able to participate in shaping the future. He describes three basic shifts of mind required if we are to create and discover an unfolding future - shifts in how we see the world, how we understand relationships, and how we make commitments - and offers a new definition of leadership that applies to all types of leaders.</p><p>Joseph Jaworski is a founder and the chairman of both Generon International and the Global Leadership Initiative and is the founder of the American Leadership Forum. In the early 1990s, he led the Shell International scenario team in London. He is a coauthor of Presence.INTRODUCTION<br><br> by Peter Senge<br><br> TELLING A STORY<br><br> For many years I have told people that, although there are a lot of books on leadership, there is only one that serious students have to read&#x2014;Servant Leadership by Robert K. Greenleaf. Most recent books on leadership have been about what leaders do and how they operate, why the world makes life difficult for them, and what organizations must do in order to better develop leaders. These books are packed with seemingly practical advice about what individuals and organizations should do differently. Yet few penetrate to deeper insights into the nature of real leadership. By contrast, Greenleaf invites people to consider a domain of leadership grounded in a state of being, not doing. He says that the first and most important choice a leader makes is the choice to serve, without which one&#x2019;s capacity to lead is profoundly limited. That choice is not an action in the normal sense&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not something you do, but an expression of your being.<br><br> This, too, is a book that anyone who is serious about leadership will have to read. Synchronicity builds directly on Greenleaf&#x2019;s thinking and goes further, especially in illuminating the nature of the choice to lead and the deep understanding or worldview out of which such a choice might arise.<br><br> For Greenleaf, being a leader has to do with the relationship between the leader and the led. Only when the choice to serve undergirds the moral formation of leaders does the hierarchical power that separates the leader and those led not corrupt. Hierarchies are not inherently bad, despite the bad press they receive today. The potential of hierarchy to corrupt would be dissolved, according to Greenleaf, if leaders chose to serve those they led&#x2014;if they saw their job, their fundamental reason for being, as true service. For this idea we owe Greenleaf a great debt. His insights also go a long way toward explaining the &#x201c;leaderlessness&#x201d; of most contemporary institutions, guided as they are by people who have risen to positions of authority because of technical or decision-making skills, political savvy, or desire for wealth and power.<br><br> Joe Jaworski takes Greenleaf&#x2019;s understanding further. He suggests that the fundamental choice that enables true leadership in all situations (including, but not limited to, hierarchical leadership) is the choice to serve life. He suggests that, in a deep sense, my capacity as a leader comes from my choice to allow life to unfold through me. This choice results in a type of leadership that we&#x2019;ve known very rarely, or that we associate exclusively with extraordinary individuals like Gandhi or King. In fact, this domain of leadership is available to us all and may indeed be crucial for our future.<br><br> I believe this broadening of Greenleaf&#x2019;s original insight is so relevant today for two reasons. First, Joe&#x2019;s book shifts the conversation beyond formal power hierarchies of &#x201c;leaders&#x201d; and &#x201c;those led.&#x201d; Increasingly, hierarchies are weakening, and institutions of all sorts, from multinational corporations to school systems, work through informal networks and self-managed teams that form, operate, dissolve, and re-form. It is not enough simply to choose to serve those you are formally leading, because you may not have any formal subordinates in the new organizational structures. Second, Joe&#x2019;s book redirects our attention toward how we collectively shape our destiny.<br><br> In the West we tend to think of leadership as a quality that exists in certain people. This usual way of thinking has many traps. We search for special individuals with leadership potential, rather than developing the leadership potential in everyone. We are easily distracted by what this or that leader is doing, by the melodrama of people in power trying to maintain their power and others trying to wrest it from them. When things are going poorly, we blame the situation on incompetent leaders, thereby avoiding any personal responsibility. When things become desperate, we can easily find ourselves waiting for a great leader to rescue us. Through all of this, we totally miss the bigger question: What are we, collectively, able to create?<br><br> Because of our obsessions with how leaders behave and with the interactions of leaders and followers, we forget that, in its essence, leadership is about learning how to shape the future. Leadership exists when people are no longer victims of circumstances but participate in creating new circumstances. When people operate in this domain of generative leadership, day by day, they come to a deepening understanding of, as Joe says, &#x201c;how the universe actually works.&#x201d; That is the real gift of leadership. It&#x2019;s not about positional power; it&#x2019;s not about accomplishments; it&#x2019;s ultimately not even about what we do. Leadership is about creating a domain in which human beings continually deepen their understanding of reality and become more capable of participating in the unfolding of the world. Ultimately, leadership is about creating new realities.<br><br> Exploring such a view of leadership through a book is almost a contradiction in terms. Because this territory can&#x2019;t be fully understood conceptually, any attempt to digest and explain it intellectually is at best a type of map. And the map is not the territory. To understand the territory, we must earn the understanding, and this understanding doesn&#x2019;t come cheaply. We all earn it in our life experience. I think this is one part of what Buddhists mean by &#x201c;life is suffering.&#x201d; We have to suffer through life, not in the sense of pain, but in terms of living through it.<br><br> One way &#x201c;to live into&#x201d; these subtle territories of leadership is through a story. When Greenleaf wrote Servant Leadership, he &#x201c;entered&#x201d; through Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s Journey to the East, an autobiographical account of one man&#x2019;s journey in search of enlightenment. Along the way, the narrator&#x2019;s loyal servant, Leo, sustains him through many trials. Years later, when the man finds the esoteric society he is seeking, he discovers that Leo is its leader&#x2014;so the servant is the leader, and leadership is exercised through service.<br><br> Here also Joe enters through a story: his own. The result is an unusual book&#x2014;rare among leadership books and rare among business books&#x2014;a personal, reflective account of one person&#x2019;s journey. This may present some difficulties for readers used to &#x201c;expert&#x201d; accounts of leadership that give advice and propound theories. Yet Joe&#x2019;s insights about leadership and the process by which he came to those insights are inseparable. His life has been his vehicle for learning, just as his learning has been about how leaders must serve life.<br><br> Furthermore, this is not just Joe&#x2019;s story, for Joe&#x2019;s personal story is interwoven with epochal events in which we all participated. This story begins when his father, Leon Jaworski, became the Watergate special prosecutor. During the investigation, Colonel Jaworski became deeply disturbed by the growing evidence implicating Nixon and his closest aides in the Watergate conspiracy. The only person he felt he could talk to without fear of compromising the investigation was his son Joe, also a lawyer. Father and son asked each other the same questions the nation would soon ask: How could this have happened? How could we have come to this&#x2014;our highest and most trusted officials acting like common criminals?<br><br> Living with these questions eventually led Joe to a remarkable series of undertakings. After several years of wrestling with his calling, he decided to leave the prestigious international law firm he had helped build. He struck off into completely foreign territory&#x2014;public leadership&#x2014;and created the American Leadership Forum (ALF). The vision of ALF was to establish a national network of talented and diverse midcareer professionals committed to bringing forth a new generation of public leadership. Today, ALF programs operate in a number of communities and regions in the United States with successful results. After almost ten years, Joe stepped down as chairman of ALF and accepted the position as head of the scenario planning process for the Royal Dutch Shell Group of companies. In this job, he helped shape what many regard as the premier planning process of any large corporation.<br><br> For me, Joe&#x2019;s story represents one person&#x2019;s journey taken on behalf of all of us who are wrestling with the profound changes required in public and institutional leadership for the twenty-first century. Our lifelong experiences with hierarchy cast a long shadow, making it difficult for us to think outside the framework of hierarchical leadership. Abuses of hierarchical authority like Watergate, sadly, are still with us today, eliciting deep concerns about our collective capability to lead ourselves. The ALF saga shows what a small group of committed people can do to positively affect public leadership.<br><br> Especially interesting for me is the juxtaposition of the ALF and Shell experiences. Joe&#x2019;s years at Shell provide a unique inside look at how Shell&#x2019;s planning process operates, including the first public presentation of the two long-term global scenarios that are now guiding thinking among Shell managers worldwide. Large multinational corporations like Shell represent a new form of social system in the world, with immense power, for good or ill, to influence the future. Today, the global corporation transcends national boundaries and has an impact in the world that goes beyond even that of governments. In this book, we begin to get a glimpse of how this power might positively influence the future. In particular, we see how the scenario process can nurture creative new ways of thinking about and influencing the future both within and beyond the corporation itself.<br><br> MEETINGS WITH REMARKABLE PEOPLE<br><br> My contact with this book also begins with a story. It was autumn, 1992, and I was in London on the way home from a European trip. I was meeting Joe for breakfast, having not seen him for some five years. In the meantime, he had left ALF, where I had helped in the early start-up period from 1980 to 1983, and he had already been working for Shell for two years. Coincidentally, I had known two of his predecessors in the position, Pierre Wack and Peter Schwartz, as well as Arie de Geus, the former head of all planning for Shell, and had some idea of the extraordinary nature of the job Joe now held. So I was eager to see my old friend and get caught up on his activities.<br><br> As he told me about the exciting work of developing Shell&#x2019;s new global scenarios, I became increasingly engaged. Then he told me about the book he was writing. In many ways Joe is a shy person, so writing a book about his life does not come easily. Yet he felt his story contained important lessons that could be shared only through a book. On the one hand, there were the fascinating stories of ALF, and now Shell. But on the other, below the surface detail of these activities, were the profound personal changes Joe had gone through, guided by a series of meetings with remarkable people such as John Gardner, Harlan Cleveland, and some of the leading scientists of our time. I was stunned when Joe told me about meeting the physicist David Bohm in 1980, a meeting I had never known about. As time had passed, Joe had come to realize that this meeting was pivotal, and that the conversation with Bohm had planted seeds within him that had taken years to develop and that now were leading him to a radically new view of how human beings could shape their destiny. When our breakfast ended, I told Joe I would do anything I could to help him finish this book.<br><br> I, too, had had a pivotal meeting with David Bohm. It was in 1989, as I was in the very final stages of writing The Fifth Discipline. David gave a small seminar at MIT for a group of us interested in his work on dialogue. At the time, I was searching desperately for a deeper theoretical understanding of a particular phenomenon I had observed in teams, which I felt was essential to understand the discipline of team learning. Over the years my colleagues and I had come to use the term &#x201c;alignment&#x201d; to describe what happens when people in a group actually start to function as a whole. We would use examples like extraordinary jazz ensembles and championship basketball teams to evoke a sense of what alignment was all about. But I knew at a deeper level I could not begin to explain how this mysterious functioning as a whole actually came about.<br><br> I also knew that what I was looking for was not available in mainstream contemporary management theories about teams. Many of these theories are essentially individualistic in nature, grounded in individual psychology or the psychology of groups. I felt deeply that this phenomenon of alignment was not individualistic at all, but fundamentally collective. I knew of no theory that in any way started to explain how the seemingly mysterious state of &#x201c;being in the groove&#x201d; (as the jazz musicians call it) or &#x201c;in the zone&#x201d; actually works. Theories based on individual reasoning, interpersonal interactions, or behavior patterns in groups seemed inherently inadequate.<br><br> In the seminar, as Bohm described his work on dialogue, I said to myself, &#x201c;At least now I know I&#x2019;m not crazy.&#x201d; Bohm talked about the phenomenon of thought and how our patterns of thought can hold us captive. &#x201c;Thought creates the world and then says &#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t do it,&#x2019;&#x201d; he said. He talked about a &#x201c;generative order&#x201d; in which, depending on our state of consciousness, we &#x201c;participate in how reality unfolds.&#x201d; Bohm&#x2019;s theory went beyond interdependence to wholeness. Interdependence is something you can see. For example, a mother and a child are interdependent in countless ways you can observe. Such interdependence is a sort of window into a deeper domain of wholeness. Interdependence exists at what Bohm called the &#x201c;explicate&#x201d; level. But wholeness exists at the &#x201c;implicate,&#x201d; which is the unmanifest or premanifest level. When we are engaged in something that is deeply meaningful and are attuned to one another, human beings can participate in the &#x201c;unfolding&#x201d; of the implicate wholeness into the manifest or explicate order.<br><br> Now, this conversation in 1989 with David Bohm was a sort of seed planting for me as well. I knew I only dimly grasped what Bohm was saying, parts of which resonated deeply with me. Other parts seemed strange, foreign to any way I had been trained to think. Over the years, reading and rereading Wholeness and the Implicate Order, where Bohm lays out the basic theory, had helped. But when Joe started to tell me that morning about his conversation with Bohm, I realized that here was a very special gift. Later, when Joe showed me the transcript of the conversation (he somehow had had the presence of mind to tape the meeting), I was struck by the simplicity and clarity of Bohm&#x2019;s way of explaining his thinking to Joe. In many ways, the personal nature of Joe&#x2019;s questions seemed to allow David to speak personally as well. Having studied his work, I can say that there are subtleties to David&#x2019;s thinking that I only began to understand through Joe&#x2019;s meeting with him. I realized that, in a sense, Joe and the story he was and is living out had the potential to become a vehicle for communicating David&#x2019;s seminal insights to a much bigger audience than he would ever reach with his own writings.<br><br> Perhaps in some way David and the other leading thinkers with whom Joe met sensed this as well. Otherwise, it is hard to understand how these meetings even would have occurred. By the time Joe met him in 1980, Bohm was already a famous physicist. Einstein had once said that Bohm was the one person from whom he ever understood quantum theory. Bohm had written the leading textbook on quantum theory in the early 1950s. Why would this man, who was quite reserved and protective of his p...</p><h2>Artificial Life: A Report from the Frontier Where Computers Meet Biology</h2><p>This enthralling book alerts us to nothing less than the existence of new varieties of life.

Each artist, dancer, and writer brings a different personality to the room, and Seliger captures that spirit in each photograph. From Paul McCartney to Susan Sarandon, from Tom Wolfe to Lou Reed, all of the participants in this project demonstrate the greatest integrity and highest creativity in their crafts. Other memorable portraits include those of Tony Hawk, Richard Serra, Bill Irwin, Laurie Anderson, and Lenny Kravitz. All 75 photographs were printed with a turn-of-the-century platinum palladium photographic process, a procedure that results in a highly detailed, rich texture. The images are printed in tritone.

Their faces and circumstances change, individually and historically, but they seem always to be with us.Today's beautiful people are performers, not aristocrats and plutocrats. They exist to be seen, and, incapable of relaxing, they are always "on." Because few are classically good-looking, they are best photographed elaborately prepared, artificially lit, and in severely controlled settings. Seliger obliges them almost completely. He shoots every one of them in the skylighted elevator shaft--"three brick walls and a crown of sun"--he uncovered when renovating his studio in Manhattan's downtown. The first two subjects are those shar-peis of rock, Jagger and Richards, guaranteeing that beauty in any normative, let alone ideal, sense is banished immediately. Each subject is expressively posed and accoutered, many are nude (fortunately, most of these thereby put on their best faces, so to speak), and if you haven't heard of some of them, you're not a New Yorker.

He is the author of several critically acclaimed novels, including <b>Stone Rain</b> and <b>Lone Wolf</b>. He lives near Toronto with his wife and has two grown children.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Cynthia stood out front of the two-story house on Hickory. It wasn't as though she was seeing her childhood home for the first time in nearly twenty-five years. She still lived in Milford. She'd driven by here once in a while. She showed me the house once before we got married, a quick drive-by. "There it is," she said, and kept on going. She rarely stopped. And if she did, she didn't get out. She'd never stood on the sidewalk and stared at the place.<br><br>And it had certainly been a very long time since she'd stepped through that front door.<br>She was rooted to the sidewalk, seemingly unable to take even one step toward the place. I wanted to go to her side, walk her to the door. It was only a thirty-foot driveway, but it stretched a quarter century into the past. I was guessing, to Cynthia, it must have been like looking through the wrong end of some binoculars. You could walk all day and never get there.<br><br>But I stayed where I was, on the other side of the street, looking at her back, at her short red hair. I had my orders.<br><br>Cynthia stood there, as though waiting for permission to approach. And then it came.<br><br>"Okay, Mrs. Archer? Start walking toward the house. Not too fast. Kind of hesitant, you know, like it's the first time you've gone inside since you were fourteen years old."<br><br>Cynthia glanced over her shoulder at a woman in jeans and sneakers, her ponytail pulled down and through the opening at the back of her ball cap. She was one of three assistant producers. "This is the first time," Cynthia said.<br><br>"Yeah yeah, don't look at me," Ponytail Girl said. "Just look at the house and start walking up the drive, thinking back to that time, twenty-five years ago, when it all happened, okay?"<br>Cynthia glanced across the street at me, made a face, and I smiled back weakly, a kind of mutual what-are-you-gonna-do?<br>&nbsp;<br>And so she started up the driveway, slowly. If the camera hadn't been on, is this how she would have approached? With this mixture of deliberation and apprehension? Probably. But now it felt false, forced. <br><br>But as she mounted the steps to the door, reached out with her hand, I could just make out the trembling. An honest emotion, which meant, I guessed, that the camera would fail to catch it.<br>She had her hand on the knob, turned it, was about to push the door open, when Ponytail Girl shouted, "Okay! Good! Just hold it there!" Then, to her cameraman, "Okay, let's set up inside, get her coming in."<br><br>"You're fucking kidding me," I said, loud enough for the crew&#x2014;a half dozen or so, plus Paula Malloy, she of the gleaming teeth and Donna Karan suits, who was doing all the on-camera stuff and voiceovers&#x2014;to hear.<br><br>Paula herself came over to see me.<br><br>"Mr. Archer," she said, reaching out with both hands and touching me just below my shoulders, a Malloy trademark, "is everything okay?"<br><br>"How can you do that to her?" I said. "My wife's walking in there for the first time since her family fucking vanished, and you basically yell 'Cut'?"<br><br>"Terry," she said, insinuating herself closer to me. "May I call you Terry?"<br><br>I said nothing.<br><br>"Terry, I'm sorry, we have to get the camera in position, and we want the look on Cynthia's face, when she comes into the house after all these years, we want that to be genuine. We want this to be honest. I think that's what both of you want as well."<br><br>That was a good one. That a reporter from the TV news/entertainment show Deadline&#x2014;which, when it wasn't revisiting bizarre _unsolved crimes from years past, was chasing after the latest drinking-and-driving celebrity, or hunting down a pop star who'd failed to buckle her toddler into a seat belt&#x2014;would play the honesty card.<br>&nbsp; <br>"Sure," I said tiredly, thinking of the bigger picture here, that maybe after all these years, some TV exposure might finally provide Cynthia with some answers. "Sure, whatever."<br><br>Paula showed some perfect teeth and went briskly back across the street, her high heels clicking along the pavement. <br><br>I'd been doing my best to stay out of the way since Cynthia and I'd arrived here. I'd arranged to get the day off from school. My principal and longtime friend, Rolly Carruthers, knew how important it was to Cynthia to do this show, and he'd arranged a substitute teacher to take my English and creative writing classes. Cynthia had taken the day off from Pamela's, the dress shop where she worked. We'd dropped off our eight-year-old daughter, Grace, at school along the way. Grace would have been intrigued, watching a film crew do its thing, but her introduction to TV production was not going to be a segment on her own mother's personal tragedy.<br><br>The people who lived in the house now, a retired couple who'd moved down here from Hartford a decade ago to be close to their boat in the Milford harbor, had been paid off by the producers to clear out for the day so they could have the run of the place. Then the crew had gone about removing distracting knickknacks and personal photos from the walls, trying to make the house look, if not the way it looked when Cynthia lived there, at least as generic as possible.<br><br>Before the owners took off for a day of sailing, they'd said a few things on the front lawn for the cameras.<br><br>Husband: "It's hard to imagine, what might have happened here, in this house, back then. You wonder, were they all cut up into bits in the basement or something?"<br><br>Wife: "Sometimes, I think I hear voices, you know? Like the ghosts of them are still walking around the house. I'll be sitting at the kitchen table, and I get this chill, like maybe the mother or the father, or the boy, has walked past."<br><br>Husband: "We didn't even know, when we bought the house, what had happened here. Someone else had got it from the girl, and they sold it to someone else, and then we bought it from them, but when I found what happened here, I read up on it at the Milford library, and you have to wonder, how come she was spared? Huh? It seems a bit odd, don't you think?"<br><br>Cynthia, watching this from around the corner of one of the show's trucks, shouted, "Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?"<br><br>One of the crew whirled around, said, "Shush," but Cynthia would have none of it. "Don't you fucking shush me," she said. To the husband, she called out, "What are you implying?"<br><br>The man looked over, startled. He must have had no idea that the person he was talking about was actually present. The ponytail producer took Cynthia by the elbow and ushered her gently, but firmly, around the back of the truck.<br><br>"What kind of horseshit is that?" Cynthia asked. "What's he trying to say? That I had something to do with my family's disappearance? I've put up with that shit for so&#x2014;"<br><br>"Don't worry about him," the producer said.&nbsp; <br><br>"You said the whole point of doing this was to help me," Cynthia said. "To help me find out what happened to them. That's the only reason I agreed to do this. Are you going to run that? What he said? What are people going to think when they hear him saying that?"<br><br>"Don't worry about it," the producer assured her. "We're not going to use that."<br><br>They must have been scared Cynthia was going to walk at that point, before they had even a minute of her on film, so there were plenty of reassurances, cajoling, promises that once this piece went on TV, for sure someone who knew something would see it. Happened all the time, they said. They'd closed cold cases for the cops all over the country, they said.<br><br>Once they had again persuaded Cynthia that their intentions were honorable, and the old farts who lived in the house had been whisked away, the show went on.&nbsp; <br><br>I followed two cameramen into the house, then got out of the way as they positioned themselves to catch Cynthia's expressions of apprehension and deja vu from different angles. I figured that once this was on TV, there'd be lots of fast editing, maybe they'd turn the image all grainy, dig around in their bag of tricks to bring more drama to an event that TV producers in decades past would have found plenty dramatic on its own.<br><br>They led Cynthia upstairs to her old bedroom. She looked numb. They wanted footage of her walking into it, but Cynthia had to do it twice. The first time, the cameraman was waiting inside her bedroom, the door closed, to get a shot of Cynthia entering the room, ever so tentatively. Then they did it again, this time from the hall, the camera looking over her shoulder as she went into the room. When it aired, you could see they'd used some fish-eye lens or something to make the scene spookier, like maybe we were going to find Jason in a goalie mask hiding behind the door.<br><br>Paula Malloy, who'd started out as a weather girl, got her makeup retouched and her blond hair repouffed. Then she and Cynthia had those little microphone packs attached to the backs of their skirts, the wires run up and under their blouses and clipped just below their collars. Paula let her shoulder rub up against Cynthia's, like they were old friends reminiscing, reluctantly, about the bad times instead of the good.<br><br>As they came into the kitchen, cameras rolling, Paula asked, "What must you have been thinking?" Cynthia appeared to be walking through a dream. "You hadn't heard a sound in the house so far, your brother's not upstairs, you come down here into the kitchen and there's no sign of life at all."<br>"I didn't know what was happening," Cynthia said quietly. "I thought everyone had left early. That my dad was gone to work, that my mother must have taken my brother to school. I thought they must be mad at me, for misbehaving the night before."<br><br>"You were a difficu...</p><h2>The Casual Vacancy</h2><p><strong>A big novel about a small town...<br><br></strong>When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.<br><br>Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty faï¿½ade is a town at war.<br><br>Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils...Pagford is not what it first seems.<br><br>And the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen.

This handsome volume features large-format, full-color photographs of farmhouses throughout the United States and Canada, accompanied by graceful text designed to educate readers about the history of farmhouses and the distinctions between regional architectural styles.</p><p>Nancy L Mohr is the author of American Barns and The Log Home also from Running Press, and her articles have appeared in Smithsonian, House Beautiful and Ladies Home Journal. She is deeply involved in agricultural and farm preservation and lives in a converted barn.Few images channel American nostalgia more effectively than that of the rural farmhouse, shaded by tall trees or open to fields and a big, blue sky. Mohr, a freelance writer and author of The Barn and The Log Home, seems especially attuned to this feeling of loss and pride, tracking it as a preservationist and living it daily as a resident of a converted barn. This collection of photographs taken in Amish country and on the Maine beachfront, shot in the Carolinas and Louisiana, features a multitude of well-preserved salt boxes and Victorian plantation houses, along with a few picturesquely dilapidated ruins as well. The photographs are straightforwardly documentary, occasionally touched with a beam of late afternoon sunshine, while the accompanying text details the farmhouses' historical and regional architectural differences. In simple, forthright prose spiced with first-person encounters with particularly appealing locations, Mohr guides the reader through a crucible of charm and wistfulness while maintaining a sense of self-awareness and genuine appreciation throughout. "These houses offer welcome, warmth and a sense of all that came before," she writes. "They each have a story to tell." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Vegetarianism: A History</h2><p>Colin Spencer provides an in-depth account of vegetarianism. From prehistory to the present, he discusses those who came to vegetarianism by choice, from the religions who preach it such as Hinduism and Seventh-Day Adventism, to the individuals who practice it, including Leonardo da Vinci and, ironically, Adolf Hitler. Throughout history, vegetarians have been maligned and persecuted by their meat-eating brethren. Spencer looks at the psychology of abstention, the ideas behind a meat-free diet, as well as the environmental effects of meat production and the implications of genetic engineering. Although the vegetarian movement dates back to 600 B.C., it is only now becoming a practice valued by many who previously would have wondered, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the beef?&#x201d;</p><p>Colin Spencer is an English writer and artist who has produced a prolific body of work in a wide variety of media since his first published short stories and drawings appeared in The London Magazine and Encounter when he was 22. His work includes novels, short stories, non-fiction (including histories of food and of homosexuality), cookery books, stage and television plays, paintings and drawings, book and magazine illustrations. He has written and presented a television documentary on vandalism, appeared in numerous radio and television programmes and lectured on food history, literature and social issues. For fourteen years he wrote a regular food column for The Guardian."A history of religion and diet...totally absorbing and fascinating." (<i>The Telegraph</i>)</p><h2>Nothing Beats Reality</h2><p>Pierre Winther is a world-renowned conceptualist, raconteur, image-maker, and visionary. For over three decades, the Copenhagen-born artist has pioneered the realms of photography and film. With his mind deeply rooted in cinema, he composes each image impeccably, telling entire narratives in a single moment. Timeless dramas unfold through depictions of organized chaos presented in bold, saturated hues. Winther uses lighting and composition to propel his subjects from the image's surface--allowing them to live among made-up and sometimes hyper-real worlds in ways that remain natural, human, and organic. And this happens without the aid of digital technology, a feat almost unheard of in photography today. It's clear that for Winther, strong concepts are what drive his work, while the medium is almost incidental. For instance, his most radical artistic treatments have been translated into award-winning commissions for Hugo Boss, Nike, Diesel, and others. His ground breaking editorial work includes spreads for <i>The Face</i>, <i>i-D</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, and <i>Vogue</i>.</p><p></p><h2>Gears Of War: Judgment Collector&#39;s Edition Strategy Guide (Signature Series Guides)</h2><p><p><b>Emergence Day&#x2019;s Aftermath </b></p> <p>For the first time, experience events immediately following the defining day in the Gears of War universe.

Do we simply cease to be? Or is death in fact the door from our world into another?<br>To find answers to these enduring questions, venerated scholar Geddes MacGregor takes us on a fascinating journey of discovery - from the ancient Middle East to modern America - in search of insight into the hidden mysteries of life after death. Along the way we explore Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Chinese religion, and Islam; learn about Karma, rebirth, and reincarnation; participate in the philosophical and theological debates prompted by the notion of afterlife; and meet people who are able to recall past lives and others who claim to have visited a world beyond ours during the fleeting moments of near-death experiences, Geddes MacGregor shows us how questions about afterlife have been asked (and often answered!) around the world and throughout history.<br>Through his interpretation of the traditional concepts of heaven, hell, purgatory, and nirvana, Professor MacGregor shows that our spiritual well-being craves not a state of eternal bliss, but the opportunity for continuing growth. Humankind's yearning for life after death also testifies to our acknowledgment of purposefulness in the cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. Professor MacGregor concludes that the kind of belief or disbelief we have toward God will reflect the kind of belief or disbelief we have in afterlife. Ultimately, humanity's common belief in afterlife points toward the grand design of the Creators whose existence tugs at our consciousness from a world beyond our own.<br>A powerful and vastly informative book, Images of Afterlife will encourage deep reflection about what awaits us in "the life everlasting" and will foster renewed appreciation of the importance of our sojourn in this lifetime.</p><p>A theological Tootsie Roll pop from MacGregor (Philosophy/USC): a tasty study of beliefs about life after death, with a gooey mess at the center--the author's own decidedly unusual views on the matter. MacGregor begins breathlessly, hurtling through a number of crucial questions pertaining to the afterlife: What is the ``I''? How does mind relate to body? Are ghosts real? (He takes them ``very seriously, indeed.'') MacGregor rejects materialist objections to afterlife (logical positivism, behaviorism, etc.), lays out the three principal understandings of survival (immortality of the soul, resurrection of the body, and reincarnation), and suggests that belief or nonbelief in God is the key factor in shaping one's views about afterlife. An excellent historical survey, which extends from neolithic burials to those of the Mormons and the Bahais, has its share of arch opinions (MacGregor describes Jainism, with its hospitals for ailing rats, as a ``parody'' of Hinduism). But little prepares one for the final chapters, a dizzying blend of Western and Eastern traditions in which MacGregor locates his own tentative belief: that Earth is Purgatory, i.e., the world of spiritual growth and expiation, where a loving God (MacGregor is a firm monotheist) oversees each person's spiritual evolution through various rebirths via the laws of karma, these rebirths being in some way analogous to Judeo- Christian-Islamic teachings of bodily resurrection. Novel, to say the least--and despite the weird conclusions, a solid introduction to the subject. (Illustrations.) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The subtitle of this work would lead the reader to expect a scholarly overview of the history of humanity's varied beliefs in life in the hereafter. Such a book might be of considerable value. Instead, what MacGregor has written is a hodegpodge of beliefs from Christianity, Hinduism, Spiritism, Egyptian mythology, Judaism, Islam, and more, all mixed together with personal anecdotes from the author's life. He begins with a "refutation" of scientific objections to an afterlife that definitely falls short. He then proceeds to pay homage to table-rappers, telepaths, and tape-recorded spooks. He does give some insight into the belief systems of various cultures, past and present, but his train of thought is fragmented and difficult to follow. This book provides little that is controversial--or enlightening.<br><i>-Dave Summers, Holly Twp.

After all, Papa came to America as a poor indentured worker from Scotland and he toiled for years until his friend Marcus, a slave, helped him to freedom. But for Bright, slavery has always been something she has only heard about. Then she discovers that Mama and Papa are hiding runaway slaves in a hidden compartment of Papa&#39;s wagon and boarding them in the barn. Soon Bright, too, becomes involved in her family&#39;s secret world. One night, when Papa falls ill, Bright discovers how dear freedom truly is--and what price it exacts from those who must struggle for it.</p><p>No BioHouston's (Year of the Perfect Christmas Tree) preface and afterword emphasize several facts and convictions that inform her at times ponderous novel: chiefly, she sees a connection between the experience of indentured servants in this country and their willingness, once freed, to help slaves escape. Bright, the heroine of her novel, is the daughter of one such former servant, Charles Cameron. Charles fled a cruel master (long before the story opens in 1853) with the help of a fellow worker, Marcus, an African sold into slavery. Marcus has safely crossed into Canada, but he returns periodically to the Camerons' North Carolina farm, a safe house on the Underground Railroad, to act as a guide to escaping slaves. Despite significant doses of stiff dialogue designed to impart historical details and weigh moral issues, Houston shapes an affecting family portrait. At its heart is Bright's growing awareness of her parents' dangerous work. There are some sad, and sadly realistic, moments here: Bright finds a half-dead slave?younger than she?who was attacked by his master's dogs, and later she learns that he and his master's daughter, who had run away with him, have been caught and killed. But she also works in some unlikely coincidences, including an incident straight out of The Sound of Music (Toby, a former apprentice of Cameron's with whom Bright has had a flirtation, is one of the Confederate soldiers who stops Bright and Marcus as they drive escaped slaves to freedom; Toby vouches for them). Despite its weak spots, this novel effectively illuminates relatively obscure but intriguing angles of American history. Ages 10-up. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>Grade 5-8-At the age of six, Bright Cameron sees what she believes is a "devil" in the hen house. This devil turns out to be Marcus, an escaped slave who is her father's friend. As the girl grows up, she is introduced to her parents' secret work: helping the runaway slaves who arrive at their North Carolina smithy travel through the Appalachian Mountains. Bright's father, who was kidnapped and brought to America as an indentured servant, feels strongly about helping others to freedom. As the Civil War approaches, the "bundles" appear with more regularity. When she is 15, Bright's father falls ill, and she and Marcus take off to make a delivery to a nearby farm. This event opens the novel and captures readers' attention. The story then backtracks to Bright's first encounter with Marcus and follows her emotional growth and understanding of the complex issues of slavery and her courageous conviction to help. Focusing on the daily routine of a family involved in the Underground Railroad, this book offers a glimpse into the danger of their situation. Though Bright's mother and Marcus are flat characters that serve to drive the plot, Bright is well drawn as a dedicated daughter and tough young woman and her father as a man who is driven to help others. Readable and well-researched historical fiction. Angela J.

Less well known are the shrewd and often ruthless strategies that went into creating such a potent symbol of luxury and cosmopolitan glamour. As historian Mark Braude reveals in his entertaining and informative <i>Making Monte Carlo</i>, the world&#x2019;s first modern casino-resort started as an unlikely prospect&#x2014;with the legalization of gambling in tiny Monaco in 1855&#x2014;and eventually emerged as the most glamorous gambling destination of the Victorian era. The resort declined in the wake of WWI, and was reinvented, again, to suit the styles and desires of the new Jazz Age tastemakers, such as F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Gerald and Sarah Murphy, and Coco Chanel.<br> <br>Along the way, we encounter a colorful cast of characters, including the fast-talking Francois Blanc (a professional gambler, stock market manipulator, and founder of Monte Carlo); Basil Zaharoff (notorious munitions dealer and possible secret owner of the casino in the 1920s); Elsa Maxwell (a brash society figure and Hollywood maven, hired as the casino&#x2019;s publicist); Rï¿½nï¿½ Lï¿½on (a visionary Jewish businessman, who revitalized the resort after WWI); Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, and other satellite members of Serge Diaghilev&#x2019;s Ballet Russes dance company; as well as Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway and other American expats who &#x2018;colonized&#x2019; the Riviera in the 1920s.<br> <br>A rollercoaster history of how a small, rural town grew into the prosperous resort epicenter of the late nineteenth century and rose again to greatness out of the ashes of WWI, <i>Making Monte Carlo</i> is a classic rags-to-riches tale set in the most scenic of European settings.</p><p>Mark Braude teaches history and urban studies at Stanford University. He holds a PhD in History from the University of Southern California and a Master&#x2019;s in French Studies from New York University. He has been a columnist for <i>The Globe and Mail</i> and has written for <i>The Daily Beast</i> and other publications. Mark was born in Vancouver and lives in San Francisco with his wife. <i>Making Monte Carlo</i> is his first book.Making Monte Carlo PREFACE<p></p> MONTE CARLO STORIES<p></p> <br>It came vividly to Selden on the Casino steps that Monte Carlo had, more than any other place he knew, the gift of accommodating itself to each man&#x2019;s humour.<br> <br>&#x2014;Edith Wharton, The House of Mirth<br> <br>IN 1863 WORK BEGAN on a new town at the eastern edge of the tiny principality of Monaco. By the close of the next decade the Monte Carlo casino-resort had emerged as the world&#x2019;s gambling playground of choice.<br> <br>In the same era, the color poster gained favor as a form of mass advertising. Posters could be printed cheaply and distributed widely, and they came out as glossy and disposable as the attractions they sold. Designed to grab the attentions of passersby hurrying through crowded urban spaces, they seduced by offering glimpses into the forbidden. Posters advertising Monte Carlo promised a town without shadows, where sun-kissed lives played out on clay courts and under canvas sails. They featured fast men and fast women doing fast things in fast machines. Only rarely did the posters show the casino that funded their production.<br> <br>People critiqued the new resort and its preferred advertising medium in similar terms. Both were deemed garish and vulgar, overly sexualized and superficial. Both pandered to the vain, venal, and selfish. Both brazenly put culture in the service of commerce.<br> <br>The first visitors to the gambling town found it looked nothing like the one in the posters. Accustomed as they were to wax museums and phantasmagorias and other pleasant lies of the age, they wouldn&#x2019;t have been particularly upset by this deception. They hadn&#x2019;t taken the long and costly trip to the coast to emulate the people in the posters. They&#x2019;d come to Monte Carlo because it was the only place for hundreds of miles to legally play at cards, dice, and wheels. Among those first visitors, any trace of glamour or luxury would have been understood merely as a nice touch, an added bonus.<br> <br>Later, after enough people had passed through and lost enough money, the real Monte Carlo started to look better than the one in the posters. Now you came for the glamour and the luxury. Now the gambling was the nice touch, the added bonus.<br> <br>This second act was in many ways harder to pull off than the first.<br> <br>At the time of its debut in 1911, the Monte-Carlo Golf Club was one of four full courses on the European continent. It was a spectacular venue, perched up on a mountainside nine hundred meters above the sea. Sheep wandered onto the fairways. Built to please the Riviera&#x2019;s British expats, it was paid for by Monaco&#x2019;s largest developer: the Sociï¿½tï¿½ Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des ï¿½trangers ï¿½ Monaco (the Sea Bathing and Foreigners&#x2019; Circle Company of Monaco, hereafter SBM). This same company owned the Monte Carlo casino and a host of other attractions in the principality. The SBM also maintained the local roads and harbor, and provided the people of Monaco with water, gas, garbage collection, and so many other services that a Guardian reporter suggested that the company was the &#x201c;real, subtle, subterranean, but omnipresent power and influence&#x201d; in Monaco, &#x201c;the State within a State.&#x201d;<br> <br>In 1928 the SBM built another dazzling attraction for its international clientele, the Monte-Carlo Beach hotel, which stood on a crescent-shaped stretch of shoreline twenty minutes walk from the main casino. With terra-cotta roofing and thatched breezeway lined with palms, its design nodded to the Mediterranean as much as it did to Hollywood or Palm Beach. This makes sense, since the hotel was the brainchild of the American press agent Elsa Maxwell, who&#x2019;d recently been hired as the SBM&#x2019;s publicist. As Maxwell liked to tell it, when she asked that the hotel&#x2019;s Olympic-size swimming pool be placed right at the edge of the ocean, the French contractor in charge was so puzzled he &#x201c;held up work until a clause was inserted in his contract guaranteeing him full payment in the event I later was proved to be mentally incompetent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Apart from their both being funded by gambling losses, the Monte-Carlo Golf Club and the Monte-Carlo Beach hotel share another common trait: neither one is located in Monte Carlo, or even in Monaco. The Golf Club covers a slope of Mont-Agel in France, while the Beach hotel sits a quarter mile to the east of Monaco in Roquebrune, also on French soil. Monaco, fabled land of luxury and sun, lacks the tableland suitable for an eighteen-hole course, as well as any decent natural beachfront.<br> <br>When Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s Riviera thriller To Catch a Thief opened in American theaters in the summer of 1955, the print campaign featured a shot of Grace Kelly and Cary Grant superimposed onto a scene of Monaco&#x2019;s harbor twinkling in the night, with a tagline that promised: &#x201c;When They Meet in Monte Carlo Your Emotions Are in for a Pounding!&#x201d; But in the film Kelly and Grant&#x2019;s characters meet at the Carlton in Cannes, and very little of To Catch a Thief takes place in Monte Carlo. Hitchcock shot most of the footage that does feature the resort stateside on the studio lot, using rear projection. And it wasn&#x2019;t while making To Catch a Thief in 1954 that Kelly met her future husband, Prince Rainier, as is sometimes claimed, but rather the following year, while she was a guest of the organizers of the nascent Cannes Film Festival. That couple&#x2019;s first meeting&#x2014;the prince offered the movie star a tour of his palace&#x2014;had been a carefully staged photo opportunity, arranged by an editor of the illustrated weekly Paris Match.<br> <br>While this book offers a history of a gambling town, it is less concerned with gambling than with tracing how a small group of men and women discovered that what was bought and sold in a casino could be something greater than the turn of a card or the spin of a wheel. Above all, this is a book about how we create places largely through the stories we tell about them, and about how places can in turn be made to suit those stories, rebelling against some and trading on others as needed. In other words, any accurate history of Monte Carlo must also include a history of the inaccuracies spun about Monte Carlo.</p><h2>CARL ERSKINE&#39;S TALES FROM THE DODGER DUGOUT</h2><p>The famed Boys of Summer -- a.k.a. the Brooklyn Dodgers -- were some of baseball&#39;s best and funniest players. The group included Hall of Famers Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, and Jackie Robinson, the game&#39;s first black player. For the first time, Carl Erskine, another member of that legendary team, relates memories about his Dodger days in this book of anecdotes. The result is a delightfully interesting trip through the world of 1950s baseball. Among Erskine&#39;s tales are his dealings with the immortal Branch Rickey, his view from the Dodger bench of Don Larsen&#39;s perfect game, and his firsthand experiences when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.</p><p>To the baseball fans of today, the name 'Dodgers' is synonymous with Hollywood, the warm California sun, and names like Tommy Lasorda, Kirk Gibson, Steve Garvey, and Orel Hershiser. The Dodgers mean much more than that to the fans of baseball history, however. Namely, these fans remember the famed "Boys of Summer," otherwise known as the Brooklyn Dodgers, a team that included some of the most storied players in baseball history. The group included Hall of Famers Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, and Jackie Robinson. Although they eventually moved out West, the Brooklyn Dodgers provided some of the greatest moments the game has ever seen and some of the greatest personalities to ever take the field. <p>Carl Erskine, another member of that legendary team, relates memories about his days with the Dodgers in a book full of true stories and revealing anecdotes. The result is Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodger Dugout: Extra Innings, a delightfully interesting trip through the world of baseball in the 1950s that includes several new stories and photos added for this edition. Among Erskineï¿½s many tales are his dealings with immortal team official Branch Rickey, his view from the Dodgers' bench during Don Larsenï¿½s perfect game in the 1956 World Series, and his first-hand experiences when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and became the first black player in Major League Baseball history. </p> <p>During his frequent speaking engagements, people often ask Erskine if all of his stories are true. His standard response has been, "Yes, I couldn't possibly make them up the way they actually happened." Now fans can read all of those great true stories in Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodger Dugout: Extra Innings.</p>Carl Erskine played twelve seasons with the Dodgers. Following his retirement in 1960, he returned to Anderson College in Indiana to coach baseball for twelve seasons, during which time his teams won four Hoosier College Conference championships and earned an appearance in the NAIA College World Series. He continues to be a community leader, participating in numerous organizations and businesses. <p>Burton Rocks is the coauthor, with former New York Yankee Paul O'Neill, of the New York Times bestseller Me and My Dad.</p></p><h2>The Dragon, The Earl, and the Troll</h2><p>In the middle of the Earl of Somerset&#39;s lavish Christmas feast, the fortress is attacked by an army of land-hungry trolls and a band of traitors, and brave Dragon Knight Sir James undertakes a mission that no one can win.

Coinciding with another of his passions, sci-fi, Paul has been cast in various roles in many episodes of Star Trek.</p>Both medievalists and sword-and-sorcery fans will enjoy this fantasy adventure, as Dickson skillfully inserts interesting facts about chivalric revels into a tale replete with dragons, trolls and knights in shining armor. Jim and Angie, the loving couple introduced in The Dragon and the George, are again in trouble with the Dark Powers-and to complicate matters, an orphaned infant has been dropped in their laps. Learning that the Dark Powers plan to tamper with History at the Earl of Somerset's upcoming, 12-day Christmas revels, the pair attend the celebrations. There, Jim, aided by the trusty English wolf Aargh, the faithful knight Brian Neville-Smythe, the magician Carolinus and a cowardly hobgoblin, must solve myriad problems so that the Phoenix at World's End will fly and Chance and History will retain their proper balance. Many of the plot twists are transparent, but the innovative use of an offbeat nativity scene offers a clever theatrical touch. Ultimately, it's Dickson's ability to wallow joyously in the conventions of the genre that makes this such a satisfying read. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Son of the Shadows (The Sevenwaters Trilogy, Book 2)</h2><p>A powerful and entracing romance, set in the Celtic twilight of 10th century Ireland: a new MISTS OF AVALON for readers of historical fantasy. The forests of Sevenwaters have cast their spell over Sorcha&#39;s daughter Liadan, who, like her mother, has inherited the talent to heal and to see into the spirit world. The forest spirits warn Liadan that she must remain for ever at Sevenwaters if the sacred isles are to be won back from the Britons who took them by force. For the Lord and Lady of the forest spirits have seen in Liadan&#39;s future a doomed romance, death; a child; and a terrible choice to be made. Liadan is taken captive by the Painted Man, who is revealed to be a man quite unlike his legend. Liadan is drawn to him, despite the ancient prophesy of doom, but can she reclaim her life and defy the spirits, or will a curse fall upon Sevenwaters because of her forbidden love? Will the fight for the sacred isles end in tragedy? History and fantasy, myth and magic, legend and love come together in this magical story.</p><p>Second of the Sevenwaters trilogy of novels about the last days of heroic Ireland, <i>Son of the Shadows</i> takes up the story of the children of Sorcha, who saved her enchanted brothers, and Hugh, the Briton she married. Sorcha's daughter Liadan is a gifted seer and healer who thinks, in spite of her visions, that she knows what the future has in store for her--caring for her dying mother and then an alliance marriage to Eamonn. A chance meeting on the road carries her off to care for a dying man--one of the mercenaries of the sinister Painted Man, Eamonn's archenemy and a killer for hire. Liadan discovers that she cannot choose whom she loves and that she and the Painted Man are as bound up in destiny as her mother and father were before her. <p> This is an intelligent historical romance in which the supernatural is a part of the character's everyday lives to an extent that makes it hard to think of the book as specifically a fantasy--these are people to whom the beings of forest speak on a regular basis and to whom sorcery is real. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Juliet Marillier was born in New Zealand and brought up in Dunedin, the `Edinburgh of the South&#39;.

But he was born to be a knight, and knights, of course, have adventures. So after his father forces his knighthood upon him, he wanders toward King Arthur&#x2019;s court in the company of a misguided young Welsh lad named Culloch. There Dinadan meets Sir Kai and Sir Bedivere, and the three find themselves accompanying Culloch on the worst sort of quest.<br><br>Along the way, Dinadan writes his own ballads, singing of honor, bravery, loyalty, and courtly love and learns that while minstrels sing of spectacular heroic deeds, honor is often found in simpler, quieter ways.</p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Grade 5-9-Morris's latest retelling of Arthurian legends introduces a reluctant knight who upholds the noble standards of Camelot in his own way. The likable and unassuming Dinadan, younger brother of the famous Sir Tristram, travels the land, encountering deceptive damsels and foolish knights. His compassion and common sense earn him the respect of many, and his keen wit satirizes the excesses of Arthurian heroism that he observes along the way. The tragic tale of Tristram and Iseult becomes a funny story "about two fools drinking from the wrong flask." Dinadan befriends a would-be knight named Culloch, but can't endure the useless parade of tasks his friend eagerly attempts to win a bride. The humor is accessible; readers don't need to know The Faery Queene to appreciate Dinadan's playful mockery of allegory (or, as he calls it, "saying things by pretending to say something else"). Along with the satire, though, Dinadan succeeds in righting some true wrongs, protecting a young woman he admires, and restoring a deposed king to his throne. Morris's skilled storytelling keeps the tale moving smoothly through various plot strands featuring many characters. The humor ranges from subtle irony to scenes of pure comedy, but never distracts from the engaging plot. Fans of the previous titles or Arthurian legend in general will thoroughly enjoy Sir Dinadan, but it stands on its own as a lighthearted introduction to the period.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pigeon Pie</h2><p>British high society, spy stories, and goofy religious cults are all gently mocked in this inventive, stylish satire.

Where had she spent the first 23 years of her life? Who was the woman in black who paid her a mysterious visit shortly before her death? How had she borne living so close to an illegitimate daughter without acknowledging her? The search for answers took Margaret on a journey into her family&#x2019;s past, examining not only her grandmother's life, but also her mother&#x2019;s and her own. The result is both a moving, evocative memoir and a fascinating commentary on how women&#x2019;s lives have changed over the past century.</p><p></p><h2>Family: Family and Borghesia, Two Novellas</h2><p>Two novellas explore the decay of the famiy and complex familial relationships</p><p>Text: English, Italian (translation)Woman of letters and member of the Italian Parliament, Ginzburg ( All Our Yesterdays , The City and the House ) has, in the two novellas that comprise this volume, rendered the essence of byzantine Italian family life and the ironies of existence. In the title story, what begins as a routine trip to the movies results in a rekindling of an intense friendship between a man and a woman, each now married and surrounded by family. In Borghesia , "a woman who had never kept any animals was given a cat." He is called Fur, and in his short lifetime with herhe dies in a fall from a rooftop because "cats lost their sense of balance when they made love"he has freedoms that his mistress would never contemplate for herself. In both novellas, the events that take place, over a long period of time, culminate in the death of the central character. Ginzburg is telling us that this is how life happens, that choices are made, and the most mundane moment leads to the next choice. Stockman's translation succeeds in conveying Ginzburg's captivating, liquid prose. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pack saddles to Tï¿½te Jaune Cache</h2><p>Tells the story of James Shand Harvey and his role in blazing a trail through what is now known as Jasper National Park in the high country of the Canadian West.</p><p></p><h2>The Bible Tells Me So</h2><p>Presented in a setting of childhood pleasures and adventures, this joyful book helps children gain a love for the Scriptures as they see the big picture of what the Bible is all about--from its lofty themes to its divine, life-giving power.

And when little Tamala Georgette Jones was born in 1970, she was considered country music&#x2019;s heir apparent. <p>For the first four years of her life, Georgette had two adoring parents who showed her off at every opportunity, and between her parents, grandparents, older sisters, and cheering fans, Georgette&#x2019;s feet seldom hit the ground. </p><p>But as in every fairy tale, dark forces were just around the corner. Her parents fought, and George drank. George and Tammy divorced when Georgette was four, and it would be years before she understood just what that meant. </p><p><i>The Three of Us </i>is an honest and heartfelt look into the life of a broken family living in the glare of the public spotlight. Like so many of her generation, Georgette had to make sense of loving two parents who couldn&#x2019;t love each other. With never-before-told stories about George and Tammy, it recounts Tammy&#x2019;s descent into prescription pill addiction, her dependence on her fifth husband, George Richey, and her untimely death at the age of fifty-five. Georgette opens up about her broken relationship with her father and what it took for them to come back together. Lastly, Georgette discusses the ups and downs of her adult life: failed marriages, illness, an arrest, and now, an unexpected but thrilling career as a musician. </p><p><i>The Three of Us </i>is a story of both extreme privilege and great trials, of larger-than-life people with larger-than-life problems. Rich in country music history, it contains twists and turns, highs and lows, but in the end, it stands as an intensely moving tale of love, loss, heartbreak, and what it means to be a family.</p></p><p><p> <b> <b>ONE</b> </b> </p><p>WHEN MY MOM MARRIED MY dad, she was marrying her hero. I&#x2019;d like to say that right up front, because one speculation I&#x2019;ve run across from time to time is that Tammy Wynette wanted to marry George Jones in order to further her career. </p><p>Mom&#x2019;s career was doing just fine when she married Dad. She was without a doubt one of the hottest new artists to hit Nashville in a while, with four #1 records and a string of awards and nominations. That&#x2019;s not to say that Mom didn&#x2019;t have insecurities about performing from the very beginning. She even questioned the vocal on her signature record &#x201c;Stand by Your Man.&#x201d; She did see Dad as the consummate vocal talent. But her career was going strong and in the hands of a man she trusted unreservedly, her producer, Billy Sherrill. </p><p>It was her personal life that was shaky, not her career. </p><p>Dad was a musical hero to Mom, but it was much more than that. Mom believed she had finally found her Prince Charming. She desperately wanted a champion. Sure, she knew he had a few rough edges when he drank, but like a lot of women have thought about men they loved, she believed she could change him. </p><p>She never could change him, but she loved Dad, even as she was leaving him. </p><p>Everyone is a product of time and environment, and none more so than Mom. She came along in the rural South just before women started seriously questioning their &#x201c;place&#x201d; in the world. She was raised by her grandfather and her stepfather, two good, kind men who respected their wives and loved their families deeply. They were men who would work hard to make sure their wives had what they wanted. Neither of these men had serious torments that complicated family life. My dad was the one who could have told her about having a father with demons to pass along. </p><p>Mom was born to Mildred and Hollice Pugh on May 5, 1942, on a six-hundred-acre farm in Itawamba County, Mississippi, just across the state line from Red Bay, Alabama. She called both states home. My grandfather Pugh knew he was dying by the time that Mom, his only child, was born. The brain tumor that was killing him was probably going to blind him first, and he told people he prayed that he would see long enough to have a look at that baby Mildred was carrying. It was an answered prayer. He didn&#x2019;t pass until Mom was nine months old and he had seen his daughter. </p><p>Hollice Pugh&#x2019;s death while Mom was just a baby probably had more of an effect on her than she ever knew. But she was lucky in that she had a big extended family and strong father figures to step into her world. Champions. </p><p>Mom&#x2019;s mother, Mildred, my beloved MeeMaw, told her that having a child made Hollice&#x2019;s last months of life bearable&#x2014;holding his baby, sitting at the piano and placing her hands on the keys, talking about his dreams that she would be a musician. He was a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, bass, mandolin, accordion, and piano. Mom listened to MeeMaw talk about Hollice&#x2019;s hopes, and they spurred her to learn both guitar and piano. In a way, it&#x2019;s sad that when she made it in music, she put aside the guitar and piano she&#x2019;d learned. But the truth is, her ability to pick up a guitar and accompany herself helped immensely when she was looking for a recording contract. </p><p>The farm where Mom was born was owned by MeeMaw&#x2019;s parents, Chester and Flora Russell. For country people, Chester and Flora were successful and prominent in the county. Still, the Russell household didn&#x2019;t have electricity or a telephone when Mom was little. And whether they are successful or not, farm families usually work in the fields. Mom was no exception as she grew up. </p><p>The economic difference between Mom&#x2019;s childhood and Dad&#x2019;s was enormous. Mom did have to do chores on the farm, but it was the <i>family</i> farm. There was stability and safety surrounding her. Dad had to quit school at a young age to help out his family. No stability and no safety, just poverty and uncertainty. </p><p>In Mom&#x2019;s life as well as mine, the grandparents often took over the parenting role. For Mom, it began when her mother took a job in Memphis to work in a wartime airplane factory. Mom was left on the farm with my great-grandparents, Chester and Flora. Even when MeeMaw returned a couple of years later, Mom always saw her grandparents as parent figures. When MeeMaw moved back from Memphis, Mom moved in with her parents. That caused a little contention from time to time, because MeeMaw was very strict, and Mom knew she could get her way with the grandparents, especially her grandfather Chester. Mom was not above playing her parents and grandparents against one another, either. </p><p>Mom dearly loved her steady, rock-solid grandfather Chester, saying, &#x201c;From him I formed the images I still carry of what a father and husband should be.&#x201d; </p><p>When she had her children, Mom ended up like her own mother and was the disciplinarian in the family. I can&#x2019;t speak for Euple Byrd, my sisters&#x2019; father, but my dad certainly never wanted to be in that role. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the idea of a child being afraid of him, as he had once been afraid of his own father. </p><p>When Mom was four years old, MeeMaw married my PeePaw, Foy Lee, and for a time, the two moved into an old, run-down house on the Russell farm. When I say &#x201c;run-down&#x201d; I <i>mean</i> run-down. Mom said that there were holes in the roof and in the floor, and they literally had to shovel snow out of it in the winter. That&#x2019;s probably why Mom stayed right where she was, with her indulgent grandparents in their nice, big, warm farmhouse. Later, when MeeMaw and PeePaw (Mildred and Foy) moved to Memphis, Mom went with them. It was short-lived. She was a popular girl who missed both her friends and playing basketball with the school team. </p><p>But even though Mom stayed at the home of her grandparents Chester and Flora, she spent a lot of time with Mildred and Foy. PeePaw was a mild-mannered man. I never even heard him raise his voice. Mom said that she saw him lose his temper only one time, when she was about six or seven years old. </p><p>PeePaw&#x2019;s father had been a raging alcoholic, far worse than my dad or any of the drinkers I ever knew. After PeePaw and MeeMaw were married, PeePaw continued to help his father take care of his farm, even though he had his own land to work. PeePaw would go over to his father&#x2019;s place after he finished his own chores and get him caught up. It made for long hours, but PeePaw believed it was a son&#x2019;s job to help his parents. He also believed that a husband and father owed his first allegiance to his wife and children. And one of the things he most loved doing was taking MeeMaw and Mom to the county fair. PeePaw, by the way, never thought of Mom as a &#x201c;stepdaughter,&#x201d; but as his daughter. PeePaw wasn&#x2019;t trying to take Hollice Pugh&#x2019;s place, but he nevertheless considered Mom his child. </p><p>He&#x2019;d been planning on a Saturday at the fair for several weeks, and Mom was revved up about it. He had all the work caught up on both places, so the family set out for the fair. PeePaw decided to stop by his father&#x2019;s house to let him know where they&#x2019;d be, and that&#x2019;s when the trouble started. PeePaw&#x2019;s dad flew into a drunken rage and started shouting that he needed more help and he needed it right then. He forbade PeePaw from leaving. </p><p>Mom said that PeePaw told him very calmly that he would come back the next day, but that he was taking his family to the fair. Then PeePaw&#x2019;s father became horribly insulting, not just toward PeePaw, but toward MeeMaw and Mom, too. PeePaw warned him once. When that didn&#x2019;t stop him, PeePaw knocked him to the ground. Then he got back in the car and took his family to the fair. </p><p>&#x201c;He never explained it or said one word about the incident,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;I was in complete shock. But the one thing I did understand was that your PeePaw wasn&#x2019;t going to allow anyone to disrespect his wife and daughter. In PeePaw&#x2019;s world, you respected women.&#x201d; </p><p>PeePaw also allowed MeeMaw to run the show in most instances. She was the one who was outspoken, the one who laid down the law. PeePaw just wanted to make her happy. I&#x2019;ve wondered if Mom might have mistakenly thought all she had to do with my dad was to &#x201c;lay down the law.&#x201d; That never was a good plan when it came to George Jones. For him, laying down the law was akin to waving a red shirt in front of a bull. </p><p>The extended family shaped Mom&#x2019;s circle of friends, too, because she considered her mother&#x2019;s younger sister Carolyn a best friend and sister rather than an aunt. Carolyn was five years older, but the two were very close growing up. They picked cotton and did other farmwork together, played at the family sawmill, washhouse, and barn, and played cowboys and Indians. </p><p>Mom was a tomboy who loved athletics more than doll playing, and by the time she made it to high school, she was a killer at the sport she so loved&#x2014;basketball. Mom was little, but what she lacked in height, she made up for in speed and accuracy. I&#x2019;d guess I&#x2019;d always known she&#x2019;d been a basketball player at one time, but I hadn&#x2019;t ever really thought about it until that day when she showed Richey&#x2019;s nephews her hook shot. </p><p>Mom&#x2019;s other early love was music. From the time she was a toddler, MeeMaw had talked to her about her father, Hollice, and his musical talents. Mom knew, for example, that her father had wanted her to have his guitar and to learn to play it well. She heard stories about his holding her at the piano while she was a baby. She took to music naturally, learning to play flute, accordion, guitar, piano, and organ. She had a natural talent, but I also think she wanted to become a skilled musician because it would have made her father proud. </p><p>Her feelings for Hollice Pugh took nothing away from her love of her stepfather, Foy Lee. The man I always called PeePaw was a wonderful stepfather.

It is a timeless, allegorical tale of initiation and had a profound impact on Rudolf Steiner and on the formulation of his teachings. He called the fairy tale a kind of "secret revelation," an "apocalypse." As the authors point out in <i>The Time Is At Hand!</i> Goethe&#x2019;s fairy tale begins with a specific image: a river separating two lands that contrast to each other, as do the sensory world and the spiritual world. The story ends with a bridge, created through sacrifice, that spans the river between the two lands.<p>Indeed, Rudolf Steiner was so deeply impressed by Goethe&#x2019;s fairy tale, that he used it as the model for his own first mystery drama, <i>The Portal of Initiation.</i> It is said that, prior to its first performance, he told friends, "I know how long and deeply you have loved Goethe&#x2019;s fairy tale, and today I am happy to tell you that you will see it performed on stage."</p><p>The twelve paintings in this book represent the soul experiences of the "Youth" in the fairy tale. These images are the fruit of an intense collaboration between the artist Hermann Linde and Rudolf Steiner, who commissioned the work. Steiner visited Linde&#x2019;s studio every day and gave him detailed indications for the treatment of the various motifs. The result is this beautifully illustrated, full-color book.</p><p>This is a fairy tale for meditation&#x2014;and for building bridges of the soul and spirit.</p></p><p><b>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</b> (1749&#x2013;1832) is a giant of German and world literature. Indeed, he coined the term Weltliteratur and spoke Greek, Latin, French, English, and Italian. In addition to its profound quality, the volume of work during his eighty-two-year lifetime is impressive. Among other works, Goethe wrote a worldwide, bestselling novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther (Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers, 1774), volumes of poetry, and several dramas, including his masterwork Faust&#x2014;a massive two-volume work that was not entirely finished by the time of the poet's death. Goethe also engaged in painting and science, from which came his Theory of Color ("Farbenlehre") among other scientific works&#x2014;a collected edition that Rudolf Steiner edited and introduced as a young man.<p><b>Hermann Linde</b> (1863&#x2013;1923) was a classically trained painter. As early as 1904, he developed a relationship with Rudolf Steiner, who encouraged him to create a form of artistic expression for those on a spiritual path. Inspired by his experiences with Steiner&#x2019;s ideas, Linde dedicated his artistic work to Anthroposophy. He participated in the creation of the stage sets for Steiner&#x2019;s first mystery drama, The Portal of Initiation, performed in Munich in 1910. Later, during World War I, he helped paint the cupolas in the First Goetheanum.</p></p><h2>Dancing in the Dark</h2><p>In the nineteenth installment of a 1940s Hollywood detective series, Fred Astaire hires Toby Peters to help him get rid of an incredibly untalented dance student, whose tutelage he has been forced to undertake by her threatening mafioso boyfriend.</p><p>Even Fred Astaire can't dance his way out of trouble without help from Toby Peters, detective to the stars in wartime Hollywood.

The disappointed Luna complains, but not for long; someone cuts her throat. As the bodies pile up, Toby also struggles with his ex-wife's decision to marry a B-movie actor and takes poundings from an enigmatic legbreaker named Kudlap Singh, formerly a professional wrestler known as the Beast of Bombay. Clues lead to a star-filled benefit at L.A.'s historic Wiltern Theatre, where danger lurks when Astaire takes the stage. As always in this engaging series, Edgar-winner Kaminsky effortlessly choreographs Hollywood history, colorful cast and dirty doings. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1943, Arthur Forbes is a respected California businessman, but not too many years earlier he lived in Detroit and was known as Fingers Intaglia because he liked to remove the fingers of his victims. Luna, his mistress, wants to learn to dance, and she wants Fred Astaire to teach her. Fred doesn't have time for private lessons, particularly when the client wants to focus on the horizontal mambo.

In December 1862, things were still confused for the Union. Antietam had been a failure for both sides, and although the battle showed that the Union army could bring the Confederates to bay, it couldn&#39;t pin them in one place long enough to destroy them. In December 1862, General Burnside, newly appointed to command the Army of the Potomac, planned to seize and secure the town of Fredericksburg, and then take the Confederate capital of Richmond.

In this country she is not nearly as well-known as she ought to be. . . . Her prose is sharp, precise, perfectly pitched, but shrinks from flashiness. . . . Her books just get crisper and more tightly controlled.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Charles McGrath, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Throughout, Lively deftly and crisply reveals the challenges and secrets in domestic relationships, as well moral and emotional qualms and the unexpected arc of unsung individual lives. . . . So graceful is her prose, so acute her understanding of the &#x2018;muddle&#x2019; of human behavior and emotional chaos beneath British reserve, it is clear this compact format also is Lively&#x2019;s mï¿½tier.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;The Seattle Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Lively has an impeccable ear. All stories but one are animated by an unflappable omniscient narrator, swimming effortlessly between exterior and interior points of view. Lively is considered a traditional writer, but her unconventional transitions are subtly experimental. . . . Her stories reinvent the world.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the wonderful things about short story collections like Penelope Lively&#x2019;s is their diversity of settings. . . . Lively&#x2019;s writing is poignantly funny, and the theme seems to be one we can all relate to: the existential misunderstanding of one another and the impossibility of changing this fact. Managing to juggle the light and dark as only the most skilled can, Lively&#x2019;s collection is well worth your time and emotions.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;<i>Read It Forward</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;How well do we ever know another person? That&#x2019;s the leitmotif of this witty but piercing new collection by Man Booker winner Lively. . . .&nbsp; Even in her darkest tales, Lively&#x2019;s fundamentally serious take on our tangled emotional lives is never bleak, merely ruefully accepting. A treasure trove of fictional gems.&#x201d;<br> <i><b>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</b></i><b> (starred review)</b><br><br>&#x201c;Lively struts her stuff in this collection of delectably acerbic and canny short stories. In gin-and-tonic prose, Lively, steeped in history and fluent in English conventions, is keenly forensic when it comes to the nature of hypocrisy and stoicism, secrecy and lies. . . . . Lively, perfect for fans of the Margarets Atwood and Drabble, as well as Shirley Jackson, neatly tracks class divides, the fizzling of marriages, and a long-brewing rivalry. Droll fables and mordant ghost stories round out this adroitly wise and mischievous gathering.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The same measured intelligence and subtle humor that characterizes Lively&#x2019;s novels is present in this story collection.

Along with Rilke and Eliot, he stands as a bridge between the tradition of the nineteenth century and the novelty of the twentieth. His reputation as a poet rests on three slim volumes published in a span of only ten years. Yet these poems, it turns out, are inseparable from another, much vaster intellectual and artistic enterprise: the <i>Notebooks</i>.</p><p>Behind the published works, behind the uneventful life of the almost forgotten and then exceedingly famous poet, there hides another story, a private life of the mind, that has its record in 27,000 pages of notes revealed in their entirety only after his death. Their existence had been hinted at, evoked in rumors and literary asides; but once made public it took years for their significance to be fully appreciated. It turned out that the prose fragments published in Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s lifetime were not the after-the-fact musings of an accomplished poet, nor his occasional sketchbook, nor excerpts from his private journal. They were a disfigured glimpse of a vast and fragmentary &#x201c;exercise of thought,&#x201d; a restless intellectual quest as unguided and yet as persistent, as rigorous, and as uncontainable as the sea that is so often their subject.</p><p><i>The Idea of Perfection </i>shows both sides of Valï¿½ry: the craftsman of sublimely refined verse, and the fervent investigator of the limits of human intellect and expression. It intersperses his three essential poetic works&#x2015;<i>Album of Early Verse</i>, <i>The Young Fate</i>, and <i>Charms</i>&#x2015;with incisive selections from the <i>Notebooks</i> and finishes with the prose poem &#x201c;The Angel.&#x201d; Masterfully translated by Nathaniel Rudavsky-Brody, with careful attention to form and a natural yet metrical contemporary poetic voice, <i>The Idea of Perfection</i> breathes new life into poems that are among the most beautiful in the French language and the most influential of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>One of the major figures of twentieth-century French literature, <b>Paul Valï¿½ry </b>was born in 1871. After a promising debut as a young symbolist in Mallarmï¿½&#x2019;s circle, Valï¿½ry withdrew from public view for almost twenty years, and was almost forgotten by 1917 when the publication of the long poem <i>La Jeune Parque</i> made him an instant celebrity. He was best known in his day for his small output of highly polished lyric poetry, and posthumously for the 27,000 pages of his <i>Notebooks</i>. He died in 1945.</p><p><b>Nathaniel Rudavsky-Brody</b> was born in Columbus, Ohio. He has translated the work of French and Belgian poets, including Benjamin Fondane, for which he was awarded the Susan Sontag Prize for Translation. He is the author of two volumes of poetry in French and one in English, and has worked as a typesetter, a programmer, and a private tutor in Greece.</p></p><h2>The Driving Book: Everything New Drivers Need to Know but Don&#39;t Know to Ask</h2><p><p>Even after taking Driver's Ed and passing that dreaded road test, there are so many things new drivers need to learn about the practical aspects of driving that will only come from experience.</p><p>Handing over the keys is a traumatic rite of passage for parents, and they will sleep better knowing that <i>The Driving Book</i> is in their teens' glove compartments. Covering virtually every scenario a new driver may face, from changing a tire to negotiating privileges with parents to handling a car in bad weather, Karen Gravelle helps teen drivers navigate through tricky new territory-on the road and at home.</p></p><p><p><b>Karen Gravelle</b> is the author of the best- selling <i>The Period Book</i>, and <i>What's Going on Down There?</i> She lives in Long Island City, New York.</p><p><b>Helen Flook</b> illustrated <i>The Middle School Survival Guide</i> for Walker &amp; Company. Helen lives in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.</p>Gr. 9-12. Every new driver needs to read this book. Writing without condescension, Gravelle covers most situations a teen (or adult) driver might encounter. She begins by taking a look at things that need to be kept in a car (from insurance cards to a flashlight), and then goes on to discuss car maintenance, stressing the importance of knowing how to check the oil, the battery, and the window washer fluid. Going beyond the basics, she suggests how to avoid peer-pressure situations and deal with road rage, and she talks about the effects of drugs, both legal and illegal, on drivers. The slim volume, which, as the author suggests, is just the right size for keeping in the glove compartment, is peppered with lively ink drawings that add a touch of humor to the advice. Parents and teens can use this as place to start talking about the rights and responsibilities of hitting the road. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

From diaries, letters, depositions, affidavits, and periodicals, here is a collection of accounts from a variety of theatergoers--who by chance saw one of the truly pivotal events in U.S. history. Providing minute first-hand details recorded over a span of ninety years, <i>We Saw Lincoln Shot</i> explores an event that will forever be the subject of debate and controversy.</p><p>"I was present at the theater and saw it all," said Samuel Koontz. "In fact, I was only about fifteen feet from the President when he was shot, although he was in a private box in the theater."</p><p>In a letter to his parent, Jason S. Knox wrote, "Dear Father, it is with sad feeling that I take up my pen and address you. Last Friday night at ten o'clock, I witnessed the saddest tragedy ever enacted in this country. Notwithstanding my promise to you not to visit the theater, I could not resist the temptation to see General Grant and the President, and when the curtain at Ford's rose on the play of <i>Our American Cousin</i>, my roommate and I were seated on the second row of orchestra seats, just beneath the President's box."</p><p>Although there have been many studies of the Lincoln assassination, few have been devoted to the actual event. Overwhelmingly, historians have been attracted to the conspiracy that preceded Lincoln's death or to the aftermath. Too few have relied sufficiently upon eyewitness accounts, and some, without considering how the human mind fails to preserve minute details in long-term memory, have trusted recollections transcribed many years after Lincoln died. With a sharp focus upon the circumstances reported by one hundred actual witnesses, <i>We Saw Lincoln Shot</i> provides vivid documentation of a momentous evening and exposes errors that have been perpetuated as the assassination has been rendered into written histories.</p></p><p><p>Collected for the first time, actual eyewitness reports of the Lincoln assassination</p>Timothy S.

This engaging book recreates the Paris that Chopin knew, providing vivid details about its people, places, politics, and arts, and their influence in the musician during this fruitful period in his career.</p><p>This book may be of greater interest to the historian--political, social, and cultural--than to the musician. As its title indicates, it is about France, particularly Paris, more than about Chopin, and presupposes considerable knowledge of French history. Chopin wanders through its pages as a peripatetic presence; there are quotes from his letters commenting on whom he meets, where he plays, what he sees and hears, with references to his friends, pupils, and publishers. The author, a New York dermatologist who has written two previous books about Chopin (including <i>Fryderyk Chopin: Pianist from Warsaw</i>), has prodigiously researched every aspect of French life between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848. He quotes copiously from contemporary writers as diverse as Balzac, Heine, Berlioz, Mrs. Trollop, and Thackeray. A meticulously detailed guided tour through Paris is followed by an account of several generations of the royal family describing their politics, personalities, fortunes, and misfortunes, as well as their habits, love affairs, interrelationships, hangers-on, and adversaries, resulting in a bewildering profusion of names.<p> Among the most interesting chapters are those on the Polish refugee community--where Chopin had many friends--and those on the artists, writers, musicians, philosophers, and theologians (including numerous crackpots) who created the city's rich cultural life in its concerts, theaters, operas, journals, and famous private salons. The writing is lively, witty, and informative, marred only by occasional infelicities like "his inseparable sister," and the book abounds with excellent illustrations. Unfortunately, it also abounds with anti-Semitic slurs; Atwood misses no chance to point out, in an insulting manner, the Jewish origin of anyone he does not like, from the Rothschilds to Heine, Meyerbeer, and Offenbach. <i>--Edith Eisler</i></p>``An artist, a man has no home in Europe save in Paris'': Nietzsche's maxim could well serve as the epigraph to this scintillating biography of Chopin and his life in the French capital, in which Atwood depicts the joys of the city in as roseate a light as his hero's talents. Though ostensibly a biographer of Chopin's time in Paris after the composer fled Warsaw to escape invading Russian troops, Atwood, whose scholarly life of Chopin appeared in 1987, appears so mesmerized by the eternal glories of the City of Lights that he almost slights the composer. He begins with a tour of the twelve arrondissements of Paris in the 1830s, a lively and detailed recounting of what we would have found there and whom we might have encountered. The heady worlds of high society and salons, where, for example, George Sand, Victor Hugo, Eugne Delacroix, Honor Daumier, and Honor de Balzac traipsed, traveled, and transgressed provide the backdrop to scandal and art, intrigue and amour. The political milieu of post-revolutionary France contributes as well to a Parisian scene ripe with expectation, plump with possibilities, where the conservative rococos and the romantic dcousus clashed over ideology and aesthetics. In this volatile mix of pomp and personality Chopin remained until his death in 1849. Atwood's keen eye for detail and his fervent zeal for this bygone world create tableau after tableau of Chopin experiencing a society delicious in its many delights, yet transformed by the ramifications of politically revolutionary acts past and present. A life of Chopin that does equal duty as a social history of Paris in the middle of the 19th century. For lovers of the city as well as fans of Chopin, the countless scenes of the Parisian worldwith their photographic clarity and robust characterizationsoffer a delightful flashback to a time long gone but well-remembered.

Karl N. Jacobson identifies these psalms as containing <i>cultic historiography</i>, historical narratives written for recitation in worship, and explores them through mnemohistory, attending to how the past is remembered and to the rhetorical function of recitation in the cultic setting. Jacobson describes mnemohistory at the intersection of memory and history, explores the singularity of the rhetorical and formals aspects of remembrance in the Asaph material, and discusses "residual mnemohistory," material that is not intentionally called to remembrance. Jacobson shows that Asaph "remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to a more orthodox form of Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants. By describing the "way Asaph remembers," Jacobson highlights symbolic and individualized elements of the psalms' mnemohistorical work that earlier form-critical approaches failed to recognize.</p><p><p><b>Karl N.

The information given about each system is brief, and most technical terms have been simplified. Smallman makes good use of analogies to explain several body functions (for example, exhaling is explained as ``pushing air out of a balloon pump''). Most notable, however, are the ``lift-the-flap'' illustrations, which allow children to observe the outside and then lift to see the system from the inside of the body. The illustrations are somewhat crudely drawn, but they are clear and help to explain the text. However, the ``lift-up'' ones may not hold up for many circulations. Several illustrations show frontal nudity. While the various ``Let's-Read-and-Find-Out'' titles (Crowell) give more information about individual subjects, this is still a good, if fragile, one-volume introduction. Kathryn M.

They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see.

It saw me through two lengthy bouts of cancer, a particularly terrifying kind that formed tumors inside my brain and tormented me with indescribable headaches. I experienced pain I could never have imagined before. Cancer destroyed my teen years and my twenties, but I was <i>determined </i>to survive.<br><br>I'd just turned sixteen the first time I was diagnosed, and I learned to knit while undergoing chemotherapy. A woman with breast cancer, who had the chemo chair next to mine, used to knit and she's the one who taught me. The chemo was dreadful&#x2014;not quite as bad as the headaches, but close. Because of knitting, I was able to endure those endless hours of weakness and severe nausea. With two needles and a skein of yarn, I felt I could face whatever I had to. My hair fell out in clumps, but I could weave yarn around a needle and create a stitch; I could follow a pattern and finish a project. I couldn't hold down more than a few bites at a time, but I could knit. I clung to that small sense of accomplishment, treasured it.<br><br>Knitting was my salvation&#x2014;knitting and my father. He lent me the emotional strength to make it through the last bout. I survived but, sadly, Dad didn't. Ironic, isn't it? I lived, but my cancer killed my father.<br><br>The death certificate states that he died of a massive heart attack, but I believe otherwise. When the cancer returned, it devastated him even more than me. Mom has never been able to deal with sickness, so the brunt of my care fell to my father. It was Dad who got me through chemotherapy, Dad who argued with the doctors and fought for the very best medical care&#x2014;Dad who lent me the will to live. Consumed by my own desperate struggle for life, I didn't realize how dear a price my father paid for my recovery. By the time I was officially in remission, Dad's heart simply gave out on him.<br><br>After he died, I knew I had to make a choice about what I should do with the rest of my life. I wanted to honor my father in whatever I chose, and that meant I was prepared to take risks. I, Lydia Anne Hoffman, resolved to leave my mark on the world. In retrospect, that sounds rather melodramatic, but a year ago it was exactly how I felt. What, you might ask, did I do that was so life-changing and profound?<br><br>I opened a yarn store on Blossom Street in Seattle. That probably won't seem earth-shattering to anyone else, but for me, it was a leap of faith equal to Noah's building the ark without a rain cloud in sight. I had an inheritance from my grandparents and gambled every cent on starting my own business. Me, who's never held down a job for more than a few weeks. Me, who knew next to nothing about finances, profit-and-loss statements or business plans. I sank every dime I had into what I <i>did </i>know, and that was yarn and knitters.<br><br>Naturally, I ran into a few problems. At the time, Blossom Street was undergoing a major renovation&#x2014;in fact, the architect's wife, Jacqueline Donovan, was one of the women in my first knitting class. Jacqueline, Carol and Alix, my original students, remain three of my closest friends to this day. Last summer, when I opened A Good Yarn, the street was closed to traffic. Anyone who managed to find her way to my store then had to put up with constant dust and noise. I refused to let the mess and inconvenience hamper my enthusiasm, and fortunately that was how my clientele felt, too.

This anniversary edition--celebrating ten years of this wonderfully evocative work--will feature discussion questions, testimonials from teachers, and an all new introduction from the author.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>"All of the [students], black, Latino, white, male, and female, talk about the unease and alienation endemic to their ages, and they do it in fresh and appealing voices.&nbsp; Rich and complex."</b><br><b>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>"As always, Grimes gives young people exactly what they're looking for&#x2014;real characters who show them they are not alone."</b><br><b>&#x2014;School Library Journal</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>"Readers will enjoy the lively, smart voices that talk bravely, about real issues and secret fears.&nbsp; A fantastic choice."</b><br><b>&#x2014;Booklist</b></p><p>Open Mike Friday is everyone's favorite day in Mr. Ward's English class. On Fridays, his 18 high-school students dare to relax long enough to let slip the poets, painters, readers, and dreamers that exist within each of them. Raul Ramirez, the self-described "next Diego Rivera," longs "to show the beauty of our people, that we are not all <i>banditos</i> like they show on TV, munching <i>cuchfritos</i> and sipping beer through chipped teeth." And while angry Tyrone Bittings finds dubious comfort in denying hope: "Life is cold. Future?...wish there was some future to talk about. I could use me some future," overweight Janelle Battle hopes to be seen for what she really is: "for I am coconut / and the heart of me / is sweeter / than you know" They are all here: the tall girl, the tough-talking rapper, the jock, the beauty queen, the teenage mom, the artist, and many more. While it may sound like another <i>Breakfast Club</i> rehash, Grimes uses both poetry and revealing first-person prose to give each character a distinct voice. By book's end, all the voices have blended seamlessly into a multicultural chorus laden with a message that is probably summed up best by pretty girl Tanisha Scott's comment, "I am not a skin color or a hank of wavy hair. I am a person, and if they don't get that, it's their problem, not mine." But no teen reader will have a problem with this lyrical mix of many-hued views.

This book, the most important and detailed ever to appear on clipper ships, is the fruit of 35 years of research. Lavishly pictorial, it&#39;s a boon to maritime historians, model makers, and dreamers alike.</p><p><p>With the sweep of its bow, its graceful lines, and its clouds of canvas, the clipper ship sparked a romance with the American public that still endures 150 years later. </p><p>The public fervor surrounding locally built clippers generated intense intercity rivalries--and a new type of thinking. Ships suddenly were christened with romantic names; interior decor of passenger-carrying vessels reached a new level of embellishment. Pushed by their masters, who drove them as no ships had been driven before, clippers reached and maintained speeds that were previously unheard of, setting records for sailing ship passages that were never to be surpassed. Their heyday was astonishingly brief--by the 1860s giving way to safer, more commodious, iron steamships, which were not at the mercy at the wind. </p><p>The product of more than 35 years of exacting research, <i>The American-Built Clipper Ship</i> presents in exquisite detail 152 clippers that comprise the culmination of the shipbuilders' art. Every facet of clipper ship design and construction is covered, including wood species, scantlings, fastenings, midship sections, interior living areas, and details of scarphs, keels, stem- and stern-post assemblies, frames, timbers, and bracing--all included in some 160 intricately drawn illustrations by a man whose unequaled work has earned him a national following among modelers and maritime museum directors. This is possibly the most complete reference on clipper ship construction ever published. No other single source covers so many vessels in such detail. </p><p><i>The American-Built Clipper Ship</i> will be an invaluable resource for historians, model builders, and maritime artists, as well as for any newcomer who is only now learning how addictive the subject can become.</p>In a real sense, <b>William L. Crothers</b> spent his entire adult life preparing this book. Hired by the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in the early 1930s, he retired after 35 years' service in naval ship design. During his long and productive career he developed the ability to draw extraordinarily crisp and detailed ship plans. And he developed a fascination with the American clipper ship--which he pursued through all the maritime museums in the United States and several in England.</p><h2>Michelangelo the Florentine</h2><p>1985. 4th Printing.

The Land of Stories is his first novel.Gr 4-6-When Alex and Conner's father unexpectedly dies, the twins lose the person who always had the perfect story to cheer them up. Then, on their 12th birthday, their grandmother gives them the book of fairy tales he used to read to them. Suddenly it seems to come to life, and the youngsters find themselves falling into the Land of Stories, seemingly with no way to get out. Desperate, they follow instructions in a mysterious journal: if they gather eight items from various residents in the kingdoms of the Land of Stories, they can complete the Wishing Spell and have one wish granted. After scaling castle walls, diving deep into the home of mermaids, and meeting characters from all of the beloved fairy tales, they are stymied by the Evil Queen, who has escaped from Snow White's dungeon. With the hope of using the spell gone, the twins appear to have no way home until they meet Fairy Godmother, their own grandmother. In a way, they find comfort from their grief over their father's death when they realize that they have been following his journal and that he grew up in this land. The writing quality in this adventure is inconsistent and detracts from the fast-paced story. The deep sadness of the twins comes through, but they are somewhat one-dimensional, since Alex is so much the nerd and Conner, the class clown. The plotline, however, pulls readers in and is entertaining, and Colfer's passion for fairy tales shines through.

After the death of his father in 1816, he was sent to England to attend school. Upon reaching college age, Thackeray attended Trinity College, Cambridge, but he left before completing his degree. Instead, he devoted his time to traveling and journalism. Generally considered the most effective satirist and humorist of the mid-nineteenth century, Thackeray moved from humorous journalism to successful fiction with a facility that was partially the result of a genial fictional persona and a graceful, relaxed style. At his best, he held up a mirror to Victorian manners and morals, gently satirizing, with a tone of sophisticated acceptance, the inevitable failure of the individual and of society. He took up the popular fictional situation of the young person of talent who must make his way in the world and dramatized it with satiric directness in The Luck of Barry Lyndon (1844), with the highest fictional skill and appreciation of complexities inherent within the satiric vision in his masterpiece, Vanity Fair (1847), and with a great subtlety of point of view and background in his one historical novel, Henry Esmond (1852). Vanity Fair, a complex interweaving in a vast historical panorama of a large number of characters, derives its title from John Bunyan&#39;s Pilgrim&#39;s Progress and attempts to invert for satirical purposes, the traditional Christian image of the City of God. Vanity Fair, the corrupt City of Man, remains Thackeray&#39;s most appreciated and widely read novel. It contrasts the lives of two boarding-school friends, Becky Sharp and Amelia Smedley. Constantly attuned to the demands of incidental journalism and his sense of professionalism in his relationship with his public, Thackeray wrote entertaining sketches and children&#39;s stories and published his humorous lectures on eighteenth-century life and literature. His own fiction shows the influence of his dedication to such eighteenth-century models as Henry Fielding, particularly in his satire, which accepts human nature rather than condemns it and takes quite seriously the applicability of the true English gentleman as a model for moral behavior. Thackeray requested that no authorized biography of him should ever be written, but members of his family did write about him, and these accounts were subsequently published.</p><h2>Blue Guide Concise Rome (Travel Series)</h2><p><p><strong>The first in the Blue Guides&#x2019; Concise city guides: small-format, attractive city guides ideal for on-site use.</strong></p> Drawn from the erudition and detailed research of the full 640-page <em>Blue Guide Rome</em>, this concise edition is a fully updated and completely rewritten distillation of the key art, architectural, and historical sites of the Eternal City; it includes the Blue Guides shortlist accommodation and dining recommendations.</p><p>The Blue Guides authors and editorial team are based in London, England.</p><h2>The Dark Water: The Strange Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes</h2><p><br>"The cliffhanger adventures of Bell and Doyle keep us enthralled, as does the -graceful flow of Pirie's evocative storytelling."-<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><br> <br>"Pirie's knowledge of Doyle's biography, as well as of the Holmes canon, makes [him] an intellectual treat and a downright guilty pleasure."-<em>The Washington Post</em><br> <br>"A convincing Victorian world of eerie moors and fearless detectives . . . with a surprising twist that ranks with the best of the Doyle canon."-<em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><br> <br>"I was utterly hooked.

He lives in Bath.<i>Starred Review.</i> Pirie's third novel, like its predecessors, <i>The Patient's Eyes</i> and <i>The Night Calls</i>, evokes the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories with a gripping plot and psychologically sophisticated characters. Again, Doyle plays the Watson role to the Holmes of Dr. Joseph Bell, the real-life inspiration for the master detective. Doyle is a complex, wounded figure, still struggling with the loss of his beloved at the hands of a madman, Dr. Thomas Neill Cream. Cream has confined Doyle to an isolated cabin at the story's outset, but the prisoner manages a desperate escape and soon is able to reconnect with his mentor and partner. In pursuit of their ingenious quarry, Doyle and Bell face an eerie mystery in a small seaside town haunted by the apparent reappearance of a legendary witch. Pirie's subtle storytelling gifts, which may remind ghost story aficionados of M.R.

(His friend Arthur advises waiting on the autobiography until Humphrey is very old so he'll know what happens in the last chapter.) Against the backdrop of changing seasons and holidays, readers follow a year's adventures of the mice and their cat-friend, Sampson. This ninth title about the church mice sports the familiar full-page and numerous smaller illustrations, which both amplify and deliberately contradict the text (to enormous comic effect). The energy and busy activity of the illustrations, which are lavishly detailed, call for close and repeated examination; many tiny dramas are going on within the larger context of the story. The long text and sophisticated level of humor based on Humphrey's self-aggrandizement recommend this for sharing with older children. Susan H.

[Jan 01, 1979] ...</p><p></p><h2>Voyages of a Simple Sailor</h2><p>Aged just 23, and already set on a life of adventure, Roger Taylor signed up as an able seaman on the square-rigger Endeavour II, bound for New Zealand. The voyage turned into a terrifying ordeal as the ship was caught in a tropical storm. Embayed between two headlands the ship was driven towards a hostile lee shore. The Endeavour II finally struck land in horrific conditions at one in the morning. There seemed little chance of survival... Following this formative experience, Roger resolved that from then on he would ever only go to sea on his own terms, single-handed and in easily manageable yachts. He built the 19&#39; Roc and twice crossed the Tasman Sea in her - the smallest craft then to have made the crossing. Roger continued to develop his ideas on the importance of simplicity in ocean voyaging and sailed his 21&#39; junk-rigged Corribee Mingming in the first Jester Challenge. This was a voyage of calms, frustrations and mature reflection.</p><p></p><h2>The Royal Family Pop-Up Book</h2><p>The Royal Family Pop-Up Book</p><p></p><h2>A Field Guide to America&#39;s Historic Neighborhoods and Museum Houses: The Western States</h2><p>A tour of domestic <br>architecture in the cities and towns <br>of the American West<br><br>In this new, information-packed field guide, the authors of the perennially popular A Field Guide to American Houses--the book that taught us how to identify architectural styles--now show us houses well worth looking at and the neighborhoods in which we can find many of them, in 110 cities and towns in seventeen western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.<br>The 172 historic neighborhoods covered contain hundreds of interesting dwellings that can be viewed, without ceremony, from the street--and almost 200 museum houses of particular architectural and/or artistic significance whose interiors can be visited.<br>The book is organized alphabetically by state, and by cities and towns within each state. An introduction to each city or town (together with descriptions of its neighborhoods and museum houses) explains how the area developed and how its architectural styles document its past.<br>There are 701 illustrations--historic and current--to instruct and entice house-lovers. The 173 maps show the location of every neighborhood and every museum house included--and point the way to the most interesting districts. <br>The book's introduction provides a chronological over-view of the entire West--with illustrations and maps that show the region's principal styles of pre-1940 domestic architecture. The appendix points out the geographic and design factors that have contributed to the overall character of various western neighborhoods.<br>Like the McAlesters' A Field Guide to American Houses, this new book is a labor of love and a work of immense knowledge that will stand as a classic in its field: an invaluable book for people fascinated with houses, for architectural buffs, and for actual--and armchair--travelers in the American West<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Virginia McAlester is a graduate of Harvard-Radcliffe College and attended Harvard Graduate School of Design.

Sketched here in fine strokes are 172 historic neighborhoods and 200 museum homes in 110 cities, covering 17 Western states from the Dakotas to Texas to the Pacific. As with other McAlester titles, there's a lot here for the price: historic, cultural, and architectural details; essays on Western settlement patterns, surveying, and neighborhood planning; and 300 illustrations and 175 maps. State-by-state treatment varies greatly, however; California claims a third of the book, while Idaho, Nevada, the Dakotas, and Utah receive a scant 20 pages or fewer.

Craughwell draws upon the latest historical and archaeological research to reveal the impact of the barbarian invasions on the modern world: from the establishment of the English language, to the foundation of world capitals such as Dublin, to the introduction of gunpowder to Europe.

But deep down we suspect that our mythic ancestors are really those so-called barbarians who broke things and created the modern world. With rarely a wasted word Thomas J Craughwell tells the stories of history-changing invasions of the Goths, Vandals, Vikings, Mongols and other marauding bands. He gives us the expected scenes of rape and pillage, but also an appreciation of the invaders' strategy, motives and their often-overlooked gifts and innovations. And he reminds us, with a fine sense of story and anecdote, that "barbarians" are what someone else calls an exotic, dangerous stranger. No one is a barbarian to him-or her-self.

A third digital revolution is here: fabrication. Today's 3D printers are only the start of a trend, accelerating exponentially, to turn data into objects: Neil Gershenfeld and his collaborators ultimately aim to create a universal replicator straight out of Star Trek. While digital fabrication promises us self-sufficient cities and the ability to make (almost) anything, it could also lead to massive inequality. The first two digital revolutions caught most of the world flat-footed, thanks to <i>Designing Reality</i> that won't be true this time.<br></p><p><b>Neil Gershenfeld</b> has been called the intellectual father of the maker movement. He leads MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms, and is the founder of the global network of over 1,000 community fab labs.<br><b>Alan Gershenfeld</b> is president of E-Line Media and former chairman of Games for Change.

This scathing, fact-filled analysis debunks it all: <br><br>- The myth that Republicans are fiscal geniuses and champions of free enterprise. <br>- The right's self-proclaimed monopoly on "family values."<br>- The conservative smearing of liberals as unpatriotic and anti-American.<br>- And of course, the "compassionate conservatism" of George W. Bush. (It depends on the meaning of &#x201c;compassionate.&#x201d;)<br><br><i>Big Lies</i> confronts right-wing slander and bias with a long-awaited, badly-needed counterpunch to the deceptions that have plagued American politics for a generation.<br></p><p>Conservative talk show hosts and newspaper columnists have made an industry out of incessantly deriding the American left, citing liberals for everything from moral decay to bad economic policy to a soft approach on terrorism. Often these accusations are bound in book form and sell quite well. Only one problem, according to Salon.com and <i>New York Observer</i> writer Joe Conason: the charges they're leveling just aren't true. In <i>Big Lies</i>, Conason dissects 10 of the most persistent, and--according to him--glaringly incorrect, arguments made by conservatives. Each chapter begins with a quotation ("Liberals control the media and misuse their influence to promote left-wing politics," "Conservatives are the only true champions of free enterprise"), which is then picked apart using statistical evidence and detailed historical research and rejected. The modern right wing, in the opinion of Conason, is not the bastion of virtue and defender of the common man it claims to be. Rather, it is a calculating and shrewdly efficient group of propagandists fueled by revenues generated by a system that rewards cronyism. Granted, it doesn't take much to deflate the bombast of shrill political talk show hosts whose very living depends on making shocking accusations about public figures, a couple of raw facts usually does the trick, but Conason offers more than simple refutation, going deeper to challenge the presumptions that generate such platitudes. And he navigates a highly readable and informative writing style that feels more substantive than Molly Ivins and Al Franken but still a lot wittier than Noam Chomsky. Many of Conason's arguments, like those of his foes, naturally come down to matters of opinion, and published material can readily be found to back up nearly any perspective.

Yes, argues acclaimed philosopher and historian of science Robert P. Crease in this engaging exploration of history&#x2019;s most beautiful experiments. The result is an engrossing journey through nearly 2,500 years of scientific innovation. Along the way, we encounter glimpses into the personalities and creative thinking of some of the field&#x2019;s most interesting figures.<br><br>We see the first measurement of the earth&#x2019;s circumference, accomplished in the third century B.C. by Eratosthenes using sticks, shadows, and simple geometry. We visit Foucault&#x2019;s mesmerizing pendulum, a cannonball suspended from the dome of the Panthï¿½on in Paris that allows us to see the rotation of the earth on its axis. We meet Galileo&#x2014;the only scientist with two experiments in the top ten&#x2014;brilliantly drawing on his musical training to measure the speed of falling bodies. And we travel to the quantum world, in the most beautiful experiment of all.<br><br>We also learn why these ten experiments exert such a powerful hold on our imaginations. From the ancient world to cutting-edge physics, these ten exhilarating moments reveal something fundamental about the world, pulling us out of confusion and revealing nature&#x2019;s elegance. <i>The Prism and the Pendulum</i> brings us face-to-face with the wonder of science.</p><p>&#x201c;Science and scientists are so often seen as cold and emotionless, but they are passionately drawn to beauty and truth, no less intensely than artists or poets. One can open this book anywhere and get a sense of this special passion&#x2014;each chapter has its own special feel and delectations, and all of them bring out that beauty, for scientists, is no less important than truth, and that one can be ravished by an experiment no less than by a work of art.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Oliver Sacks</b><br><br>&#x201c;In an era in which the public perceives science as a string of ethereal ideas conjured up by cute men in tweed jackets sitting in overstuffed leather chairs in the faculty lounge, <i>The Prism and the Pendulum</i> creates a refreshing portrait of beauty in science: of men with rough hands polishing inclined planes, peering into wells, climbing towers, or sitting in the dark looking for the one spark in eight thousand that would ignite the nuclear age. In this readable, narrative-driven book, we meet scientists wresting the truth from nature by confronting her on a physical, visceral level. Robert Crease, with this volume, destroys and corrects the &#x2018;damn good stories&#x2019; commonly used to teach science, and places himself among our most important science historians and philosophers.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Dick Teresi,</b> author of <i>Lost Discoveries</i>, coauthor of <i>The God Particle</i>, cofounder of <i>Omni</i><b>Robert P.

From Hindu mythology to Aztec sacrifices, butterflies have served as a metaphor for resurrection and transformation. Even during World War II, children in a Polish death camp scratched hundreds of butterflies onto the walls of their barracks. But as Russell points out in this rich and lyrical meditation, butterflies are above all objects of obsession. From the beastly horned caterpillar, whose blood helps it count time, to the peacock butterfly, with wings that hiss like a snake, Russell traces the butterflies through their life cycles, exploring the creatures&#39; own obsessions with eating, mating, and migrating. In this way, she reveals the logic behind our endless fascination with butterflies as well as the driving passion of such legendary collectors as the tragic Eleanor Glanville, whose children declared her mad because of her compulsive butterfly collecting, and the brilliant Henry Walter Bates, whose collections from the Amazon in 1858 helped develop his theory of mimicry in nature. Russell also takes us inside some of the world&#39;s most prestigious natural history museums, where scientists painstakingly catalogue and categorize new species of Lepidoptera, hoping to shed light on insect genetics and evolution. A luminous journey through an exotic world of obsession and strange beauty, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who&#39;s ever watched a butterfly mid-flight and thought, as Russell has, &#34;I&#39;ve entered another dimension.&#34;</p><p><b>Sharman Apt Russell</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Hunger</i> and <i>Songs of the Fluteplayer</i> , which won the Mountains and Plains Booksellers Award.

The day started just like any other, but when a gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Scarlett&#x2019;s life changed forever. However, this isn&#x2019;t a story about a massacre. It&#x2019;s a story about love and survival. It&#x2019;s about how to face the impossible, how to find courage when you think you have none, and how to choose love instead of anger, fear, or hatred. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following Jesse&#x2019;s death, Scarlett went on an unexpected journey, inspired by a simple three-word message he had scrawled on their kitchen chalkboard shortly before he died: Norurting Helin Love (Nurturing Healing Love). It was as if he knew just what his family would need in order to go on after this horrible tragedy. Bolstered by his words, Scarlett took her first step toward a new life. And with each step, it became clearer how true Jesse&#x2019;s message was. She learned that love was indeed the essential element necessary to move forward and that taking the path of love is a choice. We can live in anger and resentment, or we can choose love and forgiveness. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With her decision made, she found some peace and began to believe that choosing love was the key to creating a healthy, safe, and happy world. She began the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation to develop programs to teach children about the power each of us has to change our thoughts and choose a life without fear and hate. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nurturing Healing Love is Scarlett&#x2019;s story of how choosing love is changing her life&#x2014;and how it could change our world.

In one life, she is a well-published author and respected scholar who has traveled around the country speaking about Title IX, consent, religion, and sex on college campuses. In the other, she is a victim, a woman who suffered and suffers still because she was stalked by her graduate professor for more than two years. <br><br>As a doctoral candidate, Freitas loved asking big questions, challenging established theories and sinking her teeth into sacred texts. She felt at home in the library, and safe in the book-lined offices of scholars whom she admired. But during her first year, one particular scholar became obsessed with Freitas' academic enthusiasm. He filled her student mailbox with letters and articles. He lurked on the sidewalk outside her apartment. He called daily and left nagging voicemails. He befriended her mother, and made himself comfortable in her family's home. He wouldn't go away. While his attraction was not overtly sexual, it was undeniably inappropriate, and most importantly--unwanted. <br><br>In<i> Consent: A Memoir of Unwanted Attention</i>, Donna Freitas delivers a forensic examination of the years she spent stalked by her professor, and uses her nightmarish experience to examine the ways in which we stigmatize, debate, and attempt to understand consent today. <br><br></p><p>Donna Freitas writes both fiction and nonfiction, most recently, <i>Consent on Campus: A Manifesto</i>. She has lectured at nearly two hundred colleges and universities about her research on college students. She lives in Brooklyn."Freitas recounts with great thoughtfulness how her perception of the power differential between [herself and her stalker], as well as her faith in the religious and educational institutions she'd grown up with, lulled her into susceptibility and disbelief."&#x2015;<b><i><em><strong>New York Times Book Review</strong></em></i></b><br><br>"Donna Freitas combs through the emotional knots that form when a mentor's attention becomes inappropriate and manipulative. With sharp attention, she separates the many strands of consent one by one. A riveting, significant examination of the forces that push a student into silence about unwanted attention."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Idra Novey, award-winning author of <i>Those Who Knew</i> and <i>Ways to Disappear</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A meticulously recounted memoir of building dread, that pushes our understanding of power and its abuses. Freitas's story complicates and illuminates our ideas about harassment and harm, showing how it doesn't just begin and end within the confines of physical contact: it infiltrates our own heads, is enabled by the very structures that are supposed to be our recourse from it but too often work to cover it up."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Rebecca Traister, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Good and Mad</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In <i>Consent,</i> Donna Freitas writes an experience many women know all too well: Being stalked.

Hume</h2><p>In the tradition of his award-winning biographies, Meriwether Lewis and Fool&#39;s Gold, acclaimed historian Richard Dillon recreates the life of one of frontier America&#39;s most gifted lawmen, James B. Hume. Dillon paints a vivid picture of Hume, the greatest of Wells, Fargo and company&#39;s detectives, who ranged all over the West in search of robbers of the firm&#39;s express shipments. Formerly a sheriff in California&#39;s Mother Lode gold mining country, Hume did not operate in the usual manner of most western lawmen. Instead of using his gun in apprehending badmen, this courageous lawman preferred to rely on his brains. In collaboration with famed San Francisco policeman Isaiah Lees, Hume pioneered scientific detection in law enforcement in the American West-a science later known as criminology. In one of history&#39;s most fascinating arrests, Hume used a laundry mark to track down Black Bart, the poetry writing stagecoach robber. &#34;Dillon...has written a colorful biography of an Indiana farm-boy, James Hume, who heeded the &#39;Go West&#39; cry of his time...Dillon&#39;s portrait of the man is remarkably human and rounded.&#34; -Publishers Weekly &#34;In a fast-paced story, historian Dillon gives life to this remarkable Wells, Fargo detective. While all the excitement of the chase is here, Dillon also gives a sensitive view of the whole man.&#34; -American West &#34;Richard Dillon always writes with an adroit selection of words and phrases. In Wells, Fargo Detective he adds sardonic humor by reprinting extracts from the amazingly cold and stormy love letters Hume wrote his &#39;intended.&#39;&#34; -Arizona and the West &#34;This biography by Richard Dillon reads as smoothly as a novel. He used James Hume&#39;s own letters and diaries...He not only relates the fascinating events of Hume&#39;s public life but mines his personality as well and finds a heroic and likable figure.&#34; -Carmon Friedrich</p><p></p><h2>May Week Was In June</h2><p><p>&#x2018;Arriving in Cambridge on my first day as an undergraduate, I could see nothing except a cold white October mist.

All Our Yesterdays follows a small group of friends and lovers in Berkeley, California from their student days in the tumultuous year 1968 to the up-to-the-minute present. Some readers will compare the novel to Flaubert&#39;s Sentimental Education, others to Updike&#39;s Rabbit cycle, and still others to The Big Chill. But All Our Yesterdays is an original, a reading experience like no other. Praise for All Our Yesterdays &#34;All Our Yesterdays&#34; is smart, funny, and poignant -- a warm-hearted and simultaneously chilling reminder of where we&#39;ve been and where we&#39;ve got to. And a wonderful read. --- Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor Occasionally an all-cylinders novel comes along and ALL OUR YESTERDAYS is definitely such a creation. It touches and then goes slowly deeper and deeper into the special time and place called Berkeley. The characters are rounded and real. The story has both meaning and zip with plenty of opportunities to laugh or cry-or shout. It really is the novel with everything-for everybody who loves a good read, accomplished writing and insight into what matters. ---Jim Lehrer, Executive Editor, NewsHour If you are old enough and were engaged enough to remember when people thought their social activism could create a utopian world of peace and love, you will love this book. If you wonder how all that hope turned to violence you will find clues here. If you weren&#39;t around to debate and then wonder about those questions you will love it anyway. And, in the process, you may learn something about the zeitgeist of the late &#39;60&#39;s, and also something about life and love. It is a coming of age story for those whose youthful experience allowed them to hold on to the illusion of innocence and good intentions seemingly without end. Until one day the illusion ended. It is a totally engaging story of love and friendship -- and a reminder that some values endure. And, by the way, it is a damn good read. ---Sam Brown, organizer of the Vietnam Moratorium, former head of the Federal ACTION Agency, and Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</p><p>A generational saga of romance, lust, friendship, hatred, enduring loyalty, and sudden betrayal,&nbsp;<i>All Our Yesterdays&nbsp;</i>follows a small group of friends and lovers in Berkeley, California from their student days in 1968 to the present.&nbsp; Along the way, they deal with revolutionary changes in politics and sexual mores, personal crises and historical upheavals.&nbsp; Some will find it reminiscent of Flaubert's&nbsp;<i>Sentimental Education,&nbsp;</i>some of&nbsp;Updike's&nbsp;Rabbit cycle, some&nbsp;<i>The Big Chill. </i>But this coming of age story is an original, and above all else a wildly romantic love story.<br><i> </i><i></i><i>"All Our Yesterdays</i> is smart, funny, and poignant -- a warm-hearted and simultaneously chilling reminder of where we've been and where we've got to.&nbsp; A wonderful read."<br> -- Robert Reich, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the UC Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor<br>&nbsp;<br> "Occasionally an all-cylinders novel comes along and<i> All Our Yesterdays</i> is definitely such a creation.

Inspired by Steinbeck&#x2019;s famous 1940 book The Log from the Sea of Cortez, the author quickly proves herself an experienced and lyrical guide to one of North America&#x2019;s most unusual and rugged places. Her vivid descriptions of the abundant marine life turn readers into armchair naturalists. An encounter with a mentally unbalanced skipper, a baseball game with local villagers, and a kayaking trip in a violent storm are among the adventures and misadventures Romano-Lax chronicles here. Including a map, a delightful blend of adventure, science, and philosophy, Searching for Steinbeck&#x2019;s Sea of Cortez is a memorable trip to some of the most biologically diverse waters in the world.</p><p>Imagine hitchhiking in Baja's wilderness with a pair of toddlers in tow, then packing them into a sea kayak on the Sea of Cortez. Clearly, Romano-Lax, the author of several guidebooks to Alaska, where she resides, has a nonchalant and intrepid attitude toward travel. With her husband and two children (one still in diapers), she sets out on a journey in search of the tide pools explored by John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts 60 years ago. Her goal is to duplicate the route described in Steinbeck's The Log from the Sea of Cortez in a small sailboat captained by her mentally unstable brother-in-law. The captain jumps ship midway through the expedition, leaving the hardy family to continue by foot, rental car, bus, and charter boats as they make their way around the shores of the Sea of Cortez. Two months later, the journey ends in Guaymas with the travelers out of funds and both children recovering from minor (but frightening) injuries. This, though, is only half of Romano-Lax's story. The reader travels with Steinbeck and Ricketts as well, in combination with the author's own observations of the invertebrates that inhabit the shoreline of Baja's inland sea. There's sufficient information here for any naturalist, environmentalist, or trekker considering a similar journey to explore this little-known part of North America. The omission of photos is an unfortunate drawback. For most public and academic libraries. Janet Ross, formerly with Sparks Branch Lib., NV <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Motivated by John Steinbeck's 1941 book, <i>Log from the Sea of Cortez,</i> Romano-Lax, with her husband and two young children, completed a two-month, 4,000-mile journey in a 24-foot sailboat piloted by the author's brother-in-law. Mexico's Gulf of California, known locally by the more romantic sounding Sea of Cortez, is off the east coast of Baja California. The author recalls seeing schools of fish and stingrays, crabs, clams, mussels, and blue damselfish, to name just a few, and she describes the sheltered pools housing hundreds of tiny sea urchins. She observed pelicans, gulls, ravens, frigate birds, and sea lions, and she chronicles her trek through mangroves along the shore. She writes, too, of the oppressive tropical heat and seasickness, of trying to catch a fish for their supper, and she describes the arduous task of making a simple pot of coffee as the boat bobbed during a storm. Readers will find this a captivating guide to an extraordinary place. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Working with innovative doctors, Suzanne has created a program that alleviates symptoms such as mood swings, sleepless nights, hot flashes, and diminished sex drive that are so common as we get older. Simultaneously, her phenomenally successful Somersize program shows you how to beat a stalling metabolism and stay lean and trim while eating remarkably delicious food. With millions of people losing weight on the program, it is a proven formula for success.<br><br>Suzanne makes clear in this fascinating new book that if your hormones are out of balance, you will not be able to lose weight. Weight loss must be approached with a twofold strategy as you get older: balance your hormones the bioidentical way and eat correctly. One doesn&#x2019;t work without the other. <br><br>In <i>Slim and Sexy Forever</i> you&#x2019;ll also learn:<br><br>ï¿½ The truth about carbs: Depriving yourself of too many carbs will lead to hormonal imbalance and weight gain. Eat the right carbs to lose weight!<br><br>ï¿½ Plateau-busting tips: Suzanne explains why you hit plateaus and exactly how to push past them to achieve your goal weight.<br><br>ï¿½ The connection between adrenals and weight gain: If you blow out your adrenals trying to be Superwoman, you are going to gain weight and feel fatigued.

These are Suzanne&#x2019;s best recipes yet!</p><p>Suzanne Somers may forever be ingrained in American minds as the ditzy blond from <i>Three's Company</i>, but her five past bestselling diet books prove that her fit figure is admired by millions. Now in her 50s, Somers has endured what she calls the "Seven Dwarves" of menopause&#x2014;Itchy, Bitchy, Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful, and All Dried Up. She claims that until one tames the hormonal roller-coaster of menopause, there's little hope of losing weight: "If your hormones are out of balance, no weight-loss program will work for you." She recommends supplementation with "natural, bioidentical hormones" available from a compounding pharmacist, or an endocrinologist specializing in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT). The synthetic hormones so widely prescribed, she says, cause the body to "mimic pregnancy," and result in a "high-insulin state," both of which lead to weight gain and bloating. <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <b>Read our interview</b><br>with Suzanne Somers </td> </tr> </tbody></table>While finding these natural hormonal supplements may be difficult for some readers, as the majority of BHRT-prescribing endocrinologists practice in the Los Angeles area, Somers stresses it's worth making the trip for a BHRT appointment. Moreover, readers may balk at a major side effect of taking bioidentical hormones: the return of one's menstrual period. "To me, having a period is a small price to pay for great health, increased vitality, and a slim figure," she says. Somers adds to her hormonal advice a detailed menu plan, which includes limited amounts of whole grains, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. She also recommends a few "high-glycemic" foods to avoid at all costs. The recipes are mostly drool-worthy, with dishes including Chicken Parmigiana and Warm Chocolate Soufflï¿½ Cakes, with the less labor-intensive dishes requiring some of her packaged Somersize-brand sauces, spices, and sweeteners. While the hormone supplementation in her plan may be hard to come by, her dietary advice is much more sensible than what you'll find in the majority of weight-loss books these days.--<i>Erica Jorgensen</i> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b>From Suzanne's personal recipe collection</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Suzanne Somers lifts the veil on her upcoming books, <i>Somersize Appetizers</i> and <i>Somersize Cocktails</i>, revealing two mouthwatering recipes that will get your party started, the Somersize way. <p> <b>Chili Braised Pork with Pocatello Salsa in Butter Lettuce Cups</b> <br> From <i>Somersize Appetizers</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;PRO/FATS &amp; VEGGIES - LEVEL ONE <br> Serves 8 </p><p> This spicy and delicious appetizer is perfect alongside a cool and refreshing mojito.

With Nina (determined to prove that vamps aren't useless or weak) and Dave (secretly in love with Nina) at the helm, the misfit vampires soon band together to track down the hunter, save a werewolf, and keep the world safe from the likes of themselves. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect anecdote to slick vampire novels, this murder-mystery comedy of errors will thrill fans of <i>Evil Genius.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Catherine Jinks, </b>author of&nbsp;more than thirty books for children and adults,&nbsp;is a&nbsp;three-time winner of the Children&#x2019;s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Award.

She didn&#x2019;t know what to write next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, her teenage love interest had been dragged into a refrigerated meat locker by two thugs armed with a gun and a boning knife. But Zadia Bloodstone was already waiting for them. Hanging upside-down from a meat hook, wrapped in a long black cape and covered by a thin layer of frost, Zadia had cleverly disguised herself as a harmless side of beef. Only when she&#x2019;d spread her arms wide had the crackle of breaking ice announced her presence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang-bang! Two bullets had promptly smashed into her rib cage. But Zadia wasn&#x2019;t troubled by bullets, because her vital organs could regenerate themselves at lightning speed. Somersaulting to the floor, she&#x2019;d walked straight up to the bigger thug and kicked the gun from his hand. Then she&#x2019;d whirled around to fight off his friend. Within seconds, the two baddies had been knocked out&#x2014;leaving a very important question unanswered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would the rescued boy do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, he would be grateful. He might even be dazzled by Zadia&#x2019;s flawless face and perfect figure. But if he saw her sink her fangs into anyone&#x2019;s neck, he would also be frightened. He would realize instantly that she was a vampire and run for the door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would be unaware, at this point, that Zadia was a heroic crime-fighting vampire who preyed only on lowlife scum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina chewed away at a lock of her hair, thinking hard. She was in the middle of chapter eight. The room in which she sat was illumined solely by the glow of her computer screen; barely visible in the dimness were her brass bedstead, her Indian cushions, and her lava lamp. A poster of David Bowie hung on the wall, curling at the corners. A small bookshelf contained multiple copies of Youngblood (book two of the Bloodstone Chronicles), by someone called N. E. Harris.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splashed across the cover of Youngblood was a glamorous, slinky young girl with white skin, black hair, and ruby-red lips. She wore high-heeled boots and lots of black leather, as well as an ammunition belt. Her canine teeth were long and pointed, but she was stunningly beautiful nonetheless.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She appeared to be leaping from rooftop to rooftop, her black cape streaming out behind her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nina!" somebody shouted from beyond the closed bedroom door. Nina didn&#x2019;t respond. She stared unblinkingly at the computer screen, still gnawing at her hair&#x2014;which was thick and dark, and cut in a heavy, clumsy, old-fashioned style that didn&#x2019;t suit her bony little face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about time, she decided, that Zadia made friends with the boy she&#x2019;d rescued.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadia hesitated, Nina wrote, torn between her desire to punish the wicked and her need to reassure the tall, pale, handsome teenager with the big brown eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nina!" a distant voice called again. Ignoring it, Nina deleted the word pale. Her hands on the keyboard were like chickens&#x2019; feet, all scaly and dry. Her skin was the color of a maggot&#x2019;s, and her legs were so thin that her tights were wrinkled around the knees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her boots had flat heels on them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nina!" The door burst open to admit a withered old woman in a quilted nylon dressing gown. "For God&#x2019;s sake, are you deaf ? Father Ramon&#x2019;s outside&#x2014;you want to keep him waiting?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina sighed. She shut her laptop, moving sluggishly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right," she murmured. "I&#x2019;m on my way."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aren&#x2019;t you feeling well?" the old woman wanted to know. She had the hoarse rasp and yellowed fingertips of a chronic smoker, her hair looked like a frayed clump of steel wool, and her scarlet lipstick was bleeding into the cracks around her mouth. "Because if you&#x2019;re sick," she said, "you shouldn&#x2019;t be going."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I&#x2019;m not sick, Mum. I&#x2019;m fine."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That&#x2019;s what you always say, and you never are. Is your head giving you trouble?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your stomach?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina didn&#x2019;t reply. Instead she rose, reaching for her sunglasses&#x2014;which shared the cluttered surface of her desk with a Pet Rock, a pile of vintage vampire comics, and a volleyball trophy awarded to the "Junior Regional Interschool Champions" of 1971. Pinned on a notice board hanging above the desk lamp were various faded photographs of laughing teenage girls.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any of these girls was Nina, it wasn&#x2019;t immediately apparent. They were so sleek and glossy and bright-eyed that they could have belonged to an entirely different species.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you nauseous?" her mother nagged. "You are, aren&#x2019;t you?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There&#x2019;s nothing wrong," said Nina on her way out of the room. It was a lie of course. There was always something wrong.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her mother knew it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you get sick, I want you to come straight home," the old woman advised as they descended a narrow wooden staircase together. "Dave won&#x2019;t mind bringing you back early, if you can&#x2019;t stay to the end. And don&#x2019;t leave it till the last minute, the way you did before. Dave won&#x2019;t want you throwing up all over his sheepskin seat covers again . . ."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina winced. It was true. She had ruined Dave&#x2019;s precious seat covers. Was it any wonder that he didn&#x2019;t exactly beat a path to her door? Was it any wonder that she spent so much of her time in imaginary meat lockers with the stylish and vigorous Zadia Bloodstone? At least there were no uncontrollable bouts of vomiting in Zadia&#x2019;s world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina pulled open the heavy front door of her mother&#x2019;s row house. Outside, the darkness was relieved only by the soft glow of a nearby street lamp; stars were scattered like sequins across a coal-black sky. Yet Nina had already donned her sunglasses, which were big, heavy, wraparound things that made her pinched face look smaller than ever . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what? This isn&#x2019;t going to work. I can&#x2019;t write about myself the way I write about Zadia. It&#x2019;s too weird. It&#x2019;s confusing. Next thing I&#x2019;ll get mixed up and start making me do things that I can&#x2019;t actually do. Like turn into a bat, for instance. Zadia can do that, but I can&#x2019;t. No one can.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain fact is, I can&#x2019;t do anything much. That&#x2019;s part of the problem. Vampires are meant to be so glamorous and powerful, but I&#x2019;m here to inform you that being a vampire is nothing like that. Not one bit. On the contrary, it&#x2019;s like being stuck indoors with the flu watching daytime television, forever and ever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If being a vampire were easy, there wouldn&#x2019;t have to be a Reformed Vampire Support Group.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I was going to a group meeting that very night. Father Ramon had come to pick me up. It was a Tuesday, because all our meetings are held on Tuesdays, at nine thirty p.m., in St. Agatha&#x2019;s church hall. And in case you&#x2019;re wondering why I couldn&#x2019;t have driven myself to St. Agatha&#x2019;s . . . well, that&#x2019;s just one of my many problems. I still look fifteen, you see. I still am fifteen, when all&#x2019;s said and done, since I stopped aging back in 1973, when I was infected. So I&#x2019;d attract far too much attention behind a steering wheel. (Besides which, Mum doesn&#x2019;t have a car.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the public transport option, Sanford Plackett has ruled that out. He&#x2019;s always ruling things out; you&#x2019;d think he was our lord and master, the way he carries on. He&#x2019;s forbidden any of us to travel around Sydney on buses or trains, for instance, in case we stumble across something that Father Ramon would probably describe as "an occasion of sin." I suppose Sanford&#x2019;s worried that we might encounter a bleeding junkie rolling around on a station platform, and won&#x2019;t be able to stop ourselves from pouncing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think you&#x2019;ll never succumb," he once said to me, "because you can&#x2019;t come to terms with your true nature. You refuse to concede that you&#x2019;re really a vampire, with a vampire&#x2019;s weakness. But you are, Nina. We all are. That&#x2019;s why we have to be careful."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And being careful means not catching cabs. According to Sanford staring at the back of a cab driver&#x2019;s exposed neck would be quite stressful for most of us&#x2014;especially if someone&#x2019;s been bleeding onto the seats beforehand. Sanford also insists that no one in our group should go wandering the streets all alone. He says that we wouldn&#x2019;t stand a chance against the drunks and addicts and muggers on the loose out there. He says that everyone should follow his advice, because he&#x2019;s been around for so long and has so much experience, and because, although Father Ramon might be our group facilitator, even a priest with counseling experience can&#x2019;t be its leader. Not if he isn&#x2019;t a vampire himself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#x2019;s Sanford&#x2019;s opinion, anyway. He&#x2019;s got a lot of opinions, let me tell you. And he&#x2019;s never shy about airing them, whether asked to or not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already in the car when I reached it, because he can&#x2019;t drive either. People who grew up before the First World War rarely can. Back then, even doctors like Sanford didn&#x2019;t own cars&#x2014;and he certainly couldn&#x2019;t risk learning to drive now. None of us could. We&#x2019;d be exposing ourselves to the kind of official scrutiny that you need to avoid at all costs when you&#x2019;re toting fake IDs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the vampires I know have changed their identities at least once, and Sanford has done it twice, owing to the fact that he doesn&#x2019;t look his age (believe it or not). Despite his bald<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ing scalp and clipped mustache&#x2014;despite his preference for three-piece suits and fob watches&#x2014;you&#x2019;d never guess that he was a hundred and forty years old. The very fact that he&#x2019;s not six feet underground is a dead giveaway. And he&#x2019;s no different from the rest of our group, which is full of people living precarious lives, under assumed names, with forged papers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#x2019;s a real drag, believe me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Nina," he said as I slid into the back seat of the waiting Nissan Pulsar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Sanford."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you, Nina?" Father Ramon inquired, pulling out from the curb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh&#x2014;you know. Nauseous. As usual."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t want to complain too much, because that&#x2019;s what vampires do. They complain too much. But I needn&#x2019;t have worried. Gladys did the complaining for me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bet you&#x2019;re not as nauseous as I was last night," she said, moving over to give me some space. "I was trying to sell a time-share, and I spewed all over the phone. At least a cupful of blood. It no sooner went down than it came back up again. I lost the sale and everything&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t I, Bridget?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes," said Bridget, who was knitting. Bridget&#x2019;s always knitting. She was eighty-two when she was infected, so she can&#x2019;t do much else. Even climbing stairs can be a problem for Bridget because of her hip joints.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s only one thing worse than being a vampire, and that&#x2019;s being an elderly vampire with bad hips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you been taking your enzymes, Gladys?" asked Sanford, from the front seat. He craned around to peer at her. "Every morning, before you go to bed?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I have!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other treatments? Have you been drinking those herbal concoctions again?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Gladys exclaimed, sounding defensive, though it was a perfectly reasonable question. Gladys smells like a hippie, because she&#x2019;s always treating her manifold health problems with miraculous new oils or exercises or meditation techniques. She even looks like a hippie, in her beads and her shawls and her long, flowing skirts. Having been infected back in 1908, she can&#x2019;t bear to expose her legs; ladies didn&#x2019;t do that sort of thing in the old days, and Gladys likes to think of herself as a lady&#x2014;even though she was actually a common streetwalker. She also likes to think of herself as a young lady, despite her old-lady obsession with bowels and feet and joint pain, because she was only twenty-four when she first got infected. But I&#x2019;m here to tell you, she&#x2019;s about as young as a fossilized dinosaur egg.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven&#x2019;t even been burning scented candles," she whined, "and I&#x2019;m still getting that rash I told you about. The one on my stomach."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It might be a bad response to the supplements," Sanford mused. "I could adjust your levels a bit, I suppose. Have you had any dizzy spells?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! This morning!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about headaches?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not since last week. But the other night one of my toenails fell off in the bath&#x2014;"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I could restrain myself no longer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Here&#x2019;s an idea!" I growled, my voice dripping with sarcasm. "Let&#x2019;s all talk about our allergies for a change! That&#x2019;ll be fun."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long pause. Father Ramon glanced into the rearview mirror, shooting me one of those reproachful-yet sympathetic looks in which he seems to specialize. Sanford sniffed. Gladys scowled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what do you want to talk about, then?" she demanded. "What have you been doing lately that&#x2019;s so wonderful? Watching reruns of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I&#x2019;ve been writing my book," I said, knowing perfectly well what sort of reaction I&#x2019;d get. And when Sanford removed his sunglasses briefly, to massage the bridge of his nose, I braced myself for the usual guff about how I was putting everyone at risk (even though I write under a pseudonym and use a post office box for all my correspondence).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, yeah, I know what you think of my books," I added, before Sanford could butt in. "Spare me the sermon&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve heard it all before."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They&#x2019;re not doing us any good, Nina," he replied. "People are scared enough already; you&#x2019;re only making things worse."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zadia&#x2019;s not scary, Sanford. She gets fan mail. She&#x2019;s a heroine."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She&#x2019;s a symbol of your flight from reality." This was one of Sanford&#x2019;s stock remarks. For at least twenty-five years he&#x2019;d been telling me that I was stuck in the denial phase of the Kï¿½bler-Ross grief cycle (rather than the anger, bargaining, depression or acceptance phases), because I had refused to embrace my true identity as a vampire. "You feel compelled to invest vampires with a battery of superhuman powers," he said, making reference to Zadia Bloodstone, "just so you can tell yourself that you&#x2019;re not really a vampire. You&#x2019;re living in a dream world, Nina."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No&#x2014;you&#x2019;re living in a dream world." I was trying to be patient. "You talk to me like I&#x2019;m still a kid, even though I&#x2019;m fifty-one years old. Do you know how boring that can get?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did, of course. Everyone did, because I&#x2019;d mentioned it often enough. It had been a good thirty years since our group&#x2019;s first meeting, so we knew each other pretty well by this time. We&#x2019;d also covered every subject known to man over and over and over again. It&#x2019;s something that ...</p></p><h2>Romans, Vol. 2</h2><p>This book is part of a serious effort to join the scholarship of two branches of a unity movement so as to speak with one voice concerning the Word of God.</p><p></p><h2>Eternal Fire</h2><p>Randy dreams of his love for Laurie Mae, the Judge dreams of destruction, Laurie Mae dreams of love and suicide, and Harry Diadem dreams of love rapacious and profane, in this story to the universal battle between good and evil</p><p></p><h2>Firefly Guide to Gems</h2><p><p> <i>A reference guide to gems, semi-precious stones and crystals.</i> </p><p> Gemstones and crystals are used for jewelry, industry, lasers and precision technology. <b>Firefly Guide to Gems</b> is a practical, compact guide to the identification and use of precious and semi-precious stones, novelty stones, agates and crystals. </p><p> An introduction explains geology, chemistry and gemstone properties in clear and accessible terms.

In this context a gem is something special, highly valued and well-thought of, something to be treasured, with special attributes. </p><p> Gemstones are also treasures -- something special. Their unique qualities have been valued throughout the ages, across continents and by different peoples, from our earliest ancestors to the present-day. It may have been the color or the crystal shape of a gemstone. or a brightly colored shell that first attracted the attention of someone who then bent down to pick it up. Something special about it would have encouraged that person to keep it, to own it, maybe to put it in a special place such as a bag hung around the neck, for safekeeping, to polish or make a hole in it, or to tie it onto clothing as an adornment or as a piece of jewelry. </p><p> Gems and jewels are associated with the rich and famous, We may admire the jewels worn by our favorite film star, celebrity, or sportsperson. We may even aspire to own some particularly fine piece ourselves. Gems have been worn as a symbol of status, adorning the crowns of royalty - a visual reminder of wealth, success and achievement to both the wearer and the observer. The mystic power and energy ascribed to certain gemstones are an attribute defined by healers. The tales of famous stones, the luck they may hold or the curse they may inflict, can captivate an audience. </p><p> In choosing this book, you may already have been captivated by the 'specialness' of gemstones, or you may be interested in knowing more about them. We hope that this book inspires and informs you. It is intended as a guide to the beautiful and fascinating world of gemstones. It shows you the glorious diversity of colors and the incredible crystal shapes of these wonders of the natural world. </p><p> Some crystals look as fragile as glass and are incredibly rare, but they have an inherent strength. Crystals may take millions of years to form, or may form as you watch. They may have been formed in rocks deep beneath the Earth's surface, or they may be survivors of mountain-building episodes or devastating volcanic eruptions, or they may have been washed into rivers and streams to be retrieved maybe millions of years after their formation. These survivors are nature's treat: perfect and brightly colored crystals formed in dark, deep rocks. </p><p> But for a gemmologist (someone who studies the science of gemstones, their physical and optical properties and their origins), what are the special attributes of gemstones? For gemstones to be used in jewelry, ideally they should have three main attributes: beauty, durability and rarity. However, not all gemstones possess all three. For example, some may be insufficiently durable (hard and tough) to use as a cut gemstone in a ring, but may be good for fashioning as a piece within a brooch, protected from damage by the mounting. Beauty and rarity have a direct impact on the value of a gemstone, the more beautiful and rare, the greater the price that will be paid. </p><p> Generally speaking, gemstones are minerals that have formed as sufficiently clear, large crystals that can be cut and polished for use as pieces for personal adornment or objects d'art such as sculptures, inlays etc. Precut gemstones and minerals in matrix are also collectable. In addition to the mineral gemstones there are also other materials that can be used for adornment, such as PEARL, SHELL, AMBER and other derivatives of plants or animals. These are called organic gems. </p><p> But not all gemstones are what they seem. A gemstone that has similar properties to a more valuable or rare specimen may be used to imitate it. Color can be misleading: for example, at first glance the color of a red SPINEL might be mistaken for a RUBY. Glass, plastic and other materials both natural and man-made can also be used to imitate gemstones. </p><p> Even the assumption that a gemstone has been formed naturally in the rocks of the Earth, may not be true. Synthetic gemstones have the same chemical and physical properties as their natural equivalent, but they are made in the laboratory. Part of the excitement of being a gemmologist is to know how to use your eyes and the various pieces of equipment available in order to distinguish the imitations, fakes and forgeries from the real gems. </p></p><h2>Heir to the Empire (Star Wars)</h2><p>The tyranny has ended, but what will take its place?

Don&#39;t expect to be able to become a medical astrologer with its content, the systematic aspects are still too scarce to settle a firm diagnostic. In that aspect, the &#34;modern&#34; medical astrology is still in infancy. The traditional one (mainly the Culpeper system) refers too much to the medicine of Avicenne and Galien to be fully understood and mastered by the average astrologer.</p><p></p><h2>All My Cats</h2><p><p>In the autumn of 1965, flush with the unexpected success of his first published books, the Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal bought a weekend cottage in Kersko, about an hour's drive east of Prague. From then until his death in 1997, he divided his time between Prague and Kersko, where he wrote and tended to a community of cats. Over the years, his relationship to them grew deeper, becoming a measure of the pressures, both private and public, that impinged on his life as a writer.</p><p><i>All My Cats</i>, written in 1983 after a serious car accident, is the chronicle of a cat lover who becomes overwhelmed by his cats and his life and is driven to the brink of madness by the dilemmas his indulgent love for the animals has created.</p></p><p></p><h2>Our Dead Behind Us: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>In this collection, Audre Lorde gives us poems that explore "differences as creative tensions, and the melding of past strength / pain with future hope / fear; the present being the vital catalyst, the motivating force&#x2015;activism."</strong></p> As Marilyn Hacker has written, "Black, lesbian, mother, cancer survivor, urban woman: none of Lorde's selves has ever silenced the others; the counterpoint among them is often the material of her strongest poems."<br></p><p>In this collection, Audre Lorde gives us poems that explore &#39;differences as creative tensions, and the melding of past strength/pain with future hope/ fear; the present being the vital catalyst, the motivating force--activism.&#39;Audre Lorde (1934-1992) published nine volumes of poetry and five works of prose.

Then, when they feel ready for a greater creative thrill, they move on to other types of garments. In <i>Knitting New Scarves</i>, Lynne Barr beckons all levels of knitters back to their humble beginnings and then wows them with 27 spectacularly modern designs, each created using an innovative new technique or a unique take on a traditional one. <br><br>This novel approach, which dares knitters to rethink what is possible by simply manipulating knits and purls, leads to a collection of flattering, functional, and fun-to-make accessories. Imagine a scarf that looks like a strand of black pearls or unfolds like an accordion, one that playfully draws inspiration from the famed Chanel jacket or a twisting futuristic high-rise. <br><br>Every scarf is shown in its finished form in beautiful still-lifes by photographer Tyllie Barbosa, and, when unusual techniques are called for, up-close step-by-step photos are provided as well. This means every scarf in this masterful collection is both captivating and accessible for all levels of knitters.</p><p>LYNNE BARR has led hand-knitting workshops in the U.S., taught machine knitting to factory workers in Haiti, and designed sweaters for upscale boutiques. With her husband she designed and produced a commemorative sweater for L.L.

Its justification of America's war in Southeast Asia directly contradicts other recent studies, such as Fredrik Logevall's <i>Choosing War</i> and Robert S. McNamara's <i>Argument Without End</i>. Michael Lind, Washington Editor for <i>Harper's</i> magazine, examines the American military response to North Vietnamese aggression; American credibility during the cold war; domestic politics; and constitutional aspects of the conflict. He places the war's center of gravity in American public opinion rather than in the population of South Vietnam or the North Vietnamese army. In doing so, he can be blunt, as when he claims that members of the Western left who made excuses for the North Vietnamese land-reform terror were "apologists for state-sponsored genocide." One of his conclusions is that if the United States is to continue to be the dominant world power, "then American soldiers must learn to swim in quagmires." Viewing America's Southeast Asian adventure in the context of the cold war, Lind regards it not as a crime, betrayal, or tragic error, but as an unavoidable confrontation. Whether you agree with his arguments, <i>Vietnam: The Necessary War</i> intelligently, often vehemently, challenges preconceptions that surround the most controversial military conflict in American history. <i>--John Stevenson</i><b>Michael Lind</b> is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and the Washington editor of <i>Harper's Magazine.</i> He is also the author of five previous books, including <i>The Next American Nation</i> and <i>Up from Conservatism.</i> He has written for <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, Foreign Affairs, The Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker, The New Republic,</i> and other publications.

The U.S.News and World Report cover story of December 23, 1991 speculated that Professor Schaefer is a &#34;five time nominee for the Nobel Prize. &#34;He has received five of the most prestigious awards of the American Chemical Society, as well as the most highly esteemed award (the Centenary Medal) given to a non-British subject by London&#39;s Royal Society of Chemistry. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Moreover, his general interest lectures on science and religion have riveted large audiences in nearly all the major universities in the U.S.A. and in Beijing, Berlin, Budapest, Calcutta, Cape Town, New Delhi, Hong Kong, Istanbul, London, Paris, Prague, Sarajevo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sofia, St. Petersburg, Sydney, Tokyo, Warsaw, Zagreb and Zurich. In the present book, Dr. Schaefer&#39;s university lectures have been expanded to full length essays. Thus we have a first-hand account of the lively current science/Christianity discussions by one of the major participants. Finally, the present book describes why and how Dr. Schaefer became a Christian as a young professor of chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley. Throughout, the books retains the highly personal character of the university lectures, general respect for those with whom the author disagrees, and a delightful sense of humor.</p><p>Schaefer was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, educated in Syracuse, New York, Menlo Park, California and East Grand Rapids, Michigan. He earned his B.S. degree in chemical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966. His Ph.D. degree was earned in chemical physics at Sanford University in 1969.His first professorship was at the University of California, Berkley from 1969 to 1987. He later taught at the University of Texas, Austin. In 1987, he came to the University of Georgia as the Graham Perdue Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Center for Computational Chemistry. Over a thousand of his scientific articles have appeared in academic journals. He has received the Alexander von Humboldt Award, and the Peter Debye Award. He has spoken to an estimated 350 university audiences around the world. According to The Thomson Reuters web of Science indicates his work has been cited more than 57,000 times. For period 1981-1997, he was the sixth most highly cited chemist in the world, out of a total of 628,000 chemists whose research was referenced. More than a hundred students have earned their Ph.D. degree from him.A fascinating read worthy of careful study. He presents his personal convictions and supports them with carefully crafted argument--Dr. Marlan O. Scully, Burgess distinquished Professor, Taxas A &amp; M University and Member, U.S. National Academy of Sciences. <br><br> It is not often I read a book with which I find so much accord--Dr. Phillip Skell, Evan Pugh Emeritus Professor Pennsylvania State University, Member, U.S. National Academy of Sciences<br><br> Dr. Henry Scaefer is arguably among the top twenty living research chemists in the world. He is also a deeply committed Christian--Professor Robert Vergenz, Department of Chemistry and Physics, University of North Florida <br><br> Because of the philosophical pronouncements of some scientists and non-scientists, many people today assume that this is conflict between science and Christianity. But the eminent physical chemist and Christian Henry Schaefer shows in Science and Christianity: Conflic and Coherence? that there need be no conflict. This delightful set of essays, arising out of lectures that Professor Schaefer has delivered at hundreds of leading academic institutions around the world, answers many questions that people have about the relationship between science and Christianity and also gives examples of many leading scientist that are Chyristains--Dr. Don Page, Professor of Physics, University of Alberta and long time collaborator with Stephen Hawking <br><br> This book is a great testimony to God's power in a scientist's life--Dr. Christopher W.

As a child he was a captive of the Comanche, as a young man a proud member of a ranging company protecting settlers from Indian raids. Shannon's fate is intertwined with the young man accompanying him: Andy Pickard, himself but recently rescued from Comanche captivity and known by his captors as Badger Boy. Texas is in turmoil, overrun with murderous outlaws, lawmen exacting penalties from suspected former Confederates, night-riders, and the ever-dangerous Comanche bands. In this tempestuous time and place, Rusty tries desperately to resume his pre-war life. His friend Shanty, a freed slave, is burned out of his home by the Ku Klux Klan; his own homestead is confiscated by his special nemesis, the murderous Oldham brothers; and the son of a girl he once loved is kidnapped by Comanches. </p><p>Elmer Kelton, most honored of all Western writers, writes of the formative years of the Texas Rangers with the knowledge of a native Texan and the skill of a master story-teller.

The eponymous vixen is trapped by a forester and raised for a time in his home, where she adapts for her own needs the ways of humans and their house pets. All her basest instincts are sharpened: she kills fowl less to feed her body than her pride; she flatters adoring young males for personal gain and leaves them heart-broken; she mouths church litany to allay the suspicions of woodland critics. But when a handsome young fox takes a shine to her, she is as defenseless as a schoolgirl, risking notoriety for the joys of sex. In other words, animals are neither better nor worse than humans, neither more nor less hypocritical, greedy and self-serving. That the whimsy is heavy-handed and the little vixen far from endearing may be the fault of the translation. Except in those passages where the beauty of the Bohemian landscape is evoked, the language is pedestrian and the dialogue filled with locutions difficult to utter in any tongue. But since fables and fairy tales have delighted generations of readers, this one will probably prove no exception, especially since Sendak's illustrations add enchantment and an implicit commentary: the humans are depicted as drab and dour, the denizens of the animal and insect worlds, as charming and fey. 50,000 first printing.

Within this rural landscape Anderson has capitalized on the opportunities for many a culinary adventure. Primarily concerned with how to live off of the land and provide himself and his family with fresh, local food, Anderson has become a passionate hunter, fisher, forager, gardener, pickler, and sometimes barterer. Anderson now wants to share his secrets and experiences in order to help move people away from unhealthy eating habits and people away from unhealthy eating habits and towards a more environmentally sustainable food industry.<br><br>Food is an integral part of our lives. And in recent years, more and more people have been asking questions about the food they eat: How does that food get to our plates? How was it grown? What chemicals were used? How was the animal treated? What are the impacts on the environment?<br><br> In <i>Whole Larder Love</i>, Anderson gives us easy to follow tips and instructions for setting up a home garden, the best practices for hunting and fishing, how to identify and collect edible food growing in the wild, and the proper tools, gear, and resources to use.

Raised on a small farm in rural Victoria in south east Australia, Anderson developed not only an affinity for nature, but also an understanding, and appreciation of the role nature plays in providing sustenance. Anderson has taken these lessons into his adult life where he now grows, hunts, fishes, and forages in wild and urban surroundings to feed his family. He also documents his adventures through photography, sharing his recipes, slow food philosophies and, (sometimes contentious) views on his hugely popular blog, Whole Larder Love. Describing himself not as a chef, but rather a family cook, Anderson is influenced by rustic, peasant-style cooking, with minimal fuss involved.

This new edition includes &#39;Evolution&#39;, Barfield&#39;s only essay on physical evolution and how it relates to the evolution of consciousness. &#34;You can dig into the earth with a spade in order to get beneath the surface. The spade is itself a product of the earth, but that does not bother you. But if, by some mysterious dispensation, the spade were part of the very path of earth you were splitting up, you would be rather nonplussed, because you would destroy the instrument by using it. And that is the sort of difficulty you are up against when it is not the earth you are digging into, but consciousness; and when it is not a spade you are digging with, but language . . .

Next, he cites compelling evidence for the authenticity of the apparitions and then offers an analysis of the many messages that were delivered by the Virgin-impressive for their consistency and poignancy. Finally, he examines the prophecies that were made and often fulfilled at each site and concludes with a compelling analysis of the phenomenon of an apparition and how this relates to human history: past, present, and future. <p>In addition to the full-color insert, which depicts the enormous beauty of the apparitions of Mary, there are several appendixes at the end of the book, including a personal interview between the author and Cardinal Ratzinger.</p>Roy Abraham Varghese is co-editor of the acclaimed international bestseller on science and religion, Great Thinkers on Great Questions, considered in 1998 by Time magazine to be &#34;the year&#39;s most intriguing book about God.&#34;</p><h2>Ghosts of Gettysburg IV: Spirits, Apparitions and Haunted Places of the Battlefield</h2><p>What ever became of Joshua Chamberlain's siblings; sister Sarah and brothers Horace,Tom, &amp; John?

In 1956, in the wake of the Hungarian Revolution, Plachy and her parents escaped into Austria carrying only a small valise. She returned to Hungary eight years later, this time with a camera in hand. Through the gently subversive images gathered here, her life is revealed via clues, fragments of words and pictures as if by someone looking into a mirror and seeing her life pass before her eyes--not linearly like a film, but rather in layers.</p><p><br><b>Sylvia</b> <b>Plachy</b>'s other books include Unguided Tour (Aperture, 1990), for which she won an International Center of Photography Infinity Award; Red Light, a book of documentary work on the sex industry (1996); and Signs and Relics (2000). Plachy has had one-person shows at the Whitney Museum at Philip Morris, the Queens Museum, and the Minneapolis Institute of Fine Arts, among other venues in the United States, as well as in Budapest, Ljubljana, Manchester, Berlin, Vancouver, Perpignan, Arles, and Pingyau, China. She has won a Guggenheim fellowship, and publishes regularly in periodicals including the The New Yorker, TIME, Smithsonian, GEO, and The Village Voice.<br><br>"A strikingly original photographer, Sylvia Plachy came to America as a young refugee from Hungary in the 1950's. The photographs in this book -- as much personal history as it is documentary -- were made during many later trips to Eastern Europe, and they capture the searching and romantic flavor of those journeys back to her lost childhood." -- Philip Gefter --The New York Times<br><br>"The Hungarian-born Sylvia Plachy, a photojournalist with a literary sensibility, looked at her own life and past to produce Self Portrait with Cows Going Home, a personal history of Eastern Europe. It shows, most of all, her faith in her instinct and reactions. She looks, she finds, she discovers, but never with a destination in mind." -- Christopher D. Ringwald --Photo District News<br><br>"Plachy uses her family history, in photos and text, as a jumping off point for a rambling journey through Eastern Europe before and after the collapse of Communism. Working with a variety of cameras and formats, she rarely approaches this emotionally laden material head-on, preferring a serendipitous, impressionistic indirection. Plachy learned early on that, while life was almost always tragic, 'art could and had to sustain you,' and every tangent she follows leads her, and her grateful readers, right back to this fundamental truth." -- Vince Aletti --Photograph magazine<br><br>"They are images steeped in old Europe in someplace long ago, far away and always just around the corner. In many ways these images are about people, places, the combining and conflating of past and present, memory and imagining, conjuring experience, the visual revisitation of fragments stored. They are hauntingly beautiful." -- A. M. Homes --Bomb Magazine<br><br>"The first front of the post-9/11 'war on terror' is still a place where poverty and progress compete. Photographer and Afghan refugee Zalmai's vision of his homeland is hopeful and haunting." -- Stephen W. Stromberg --The Los Angeles Times<br><br>"Zalmai's experience and knowledge of the Afghan people grants us a privileged view of their lives. Clinging to the ruins of a house in deep winter against the backdrop of the unforgiving snow-covered mountains or crawling amongst the ruins of the great Buddhas of Banian, which the Taliban destroyed, the Afghan people in his photographs display a proud hope. The life they have returned to is uncompromisingly harsh, and the means to survive and rebuild frustratingly absent, yet the faces we see look at us with desire and determination." --Ei8ht<br><br>"Working in rich colour, and frequently using a panoramic format that embraces the vastness of the sky and sand, Zalmai immerses us in the ravaged landscape and the bustle of reconstruction." --HotShoe International<br><br>"While the realities Zalmaï¿½ pictures in Return, Afghanistan are harsh, his photographs are nothing if not lively--children playing amid the ruins, men rebuilding bombed-out roads, schools reopening, farmers reaping their first harvest in years, councils meeting to plan for the future." -- Edgar Allen Beem --Photo District News<br><br>"There are some incredibly strong images in this book, with graphic panoramas depicting local people... and the changed appearance of the landscape, having suffered the ravages of conflict. Zalmaï¿½ has found colour aplenty, like the multicoloured trucks bringing refugees back to Afghanistan from Pakistan, or the girls in bright headscarves having lessons in the shell of a bus in Kabul. The suffering goes on, but the message in this book is one of hope, conveyed through excellent photography." -- Sarah Jackson --Amateur Photographer</p><h2>Mary, Queen of Scots : And the Murder of Lord Darnley</h2><p>On the night of 10 February 1567, an explosion devastated the Edinburgh residence of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. The noise was heard as far away as Holyrood Palace, where Queen Mary was attending a wedding masque. Those arriving at the scene of devastation found, in the garden, the naked corpses of Darnley and his valet. Neither had died in the explosion, but both bodies bore marks of strangulation. It was clear that they had been murdered and the house destroyed in an attempt to obliterate the evidence. Darnley was not a popular king-consort, but he was regarded by many as having a valid claim to the English throne. For this reason Elizabeth I had opposed his family&#39;s longstanding wish to marry him to Mary Stuart, who herself claimed to be the rightful queen of England. Alison Weir&#39;s investigation of Darnley&#39;s murder is set against one of the most dramatic periods in British history. Her conclusions will shed a brilliant new light on the actions and motives of the conspirators and, in particular, the extent of Mary&#39;s own involvement.</p><p>d author of <i>The Princes in the Tower</i> now brilliantly investigates another of Britain&#x2019;s notorious unsolved mysteries: the murder of Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.<br><br>Tall, handsome, accomplished, and charming, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, had it all, including a strong claim to the English throne, a fact that threatened the already insecure Elizabeth I. She therefore opposed any plan for Darnley to marry her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who herself claimed to be Queen of England. But in 1565 Mary met and fell in love with Darnley&#x2014;and defied Elizabeth by marrying him. It was not long before she discovered that her new husband was weak and vicious, and interested only in securing sovereign power for himself. <br><br>On February 10, 1567, an explosion at his lodgings left Darnley dead. There were many who might have had a motive for murdering him, not least Mary herself. The intrigue thickened after it was discovered that apparently he had beAlison Weir lives and works in Surrey.

His coming was announced many hundreds of years before Mary gave birth in Bethlehem, and all who were spiritually enlightened knew that the Christ who would come would bring the blessings of salvation and eternal life. The Promised Messiah: The First Coming of Christ presents a careful analysis of those prophecies concerning the First Coming of the Lord. &#34;What is here considered,&#34; says the author, Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Council of the Twelve, &#34;was the heart and core of the teachings of all the preachers of righteousness who lived before he dwelt among men. In the course of this discussion, it becomes evident that the fulness of God&#39;s everlasting gospel has been available to men in every age, that the plan of salvation is eternal and unchanging from century to century, and that the same principles and doctrines which were given to save men in the days of Christ saved men in the days of Abraham, and will save them in the present day. But most important of all these teachings is the understanding that Christ is the Savior, that he did indeed come to make atonement for the sins of men and thus opened up the way for them to return to his presence.</p><p></p><h2>Initials and Decorative Alphabets (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Type designers and scribes creating manuscripts and books have always been fascinated with ornamenting initials in documents or books.

Van Auken explores the secrets of the Great Pyramid and the hidden mysteries of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and recounts the story of Ra Ta (Edgar Cayces earlier life as a high priest of Egypt), including the events that, according to Cayce, led to the building of the Great Pyramid as a place of initiation. Also covered is the expected discovery of the Hall of Records predicted by Cayce.</p><p>Ancient Egyptican Mysticism explores the hidden symbolism of ancient temples and correlates it with the human bodys glands and chakras. Not many know that the ancient Egyptians were masters of what would later be called kundalini meditation. We actually have much to learn from these high initiates, who had a much deeper vision of the eternal and the divine than we have ever realized. Fortunately, they left us a complete record of their wisdom in the form of temples, paintings, and special symbols, which the author interprets for us. Illustrated with 50 full-color photographs.John Van Auken is a world authority on Edgar Cayce and ancient Egypt. He has guided dozens of spiritual tours of the pyramids and temples of Egypt and has been interviewed on many radio and television shows, most recently the Fox-TV special Opening the Tombs -- Live from Egypt.

In comparison to its predecessors it takes a more in-depth look at the practical nature of abstract art. With a detailed explanation of the technical aspects of painting, the book covers figurative elements, composition and construction work specifically. Abstracts Techniques and Textures is a comprehensive handbook for amateurs, professionals, teachers and students alike to learn the intricacies of painting abstracts.<br> It features 50 studies detailing dozens of techniques and textures readers can use to practise achieving abstract and non-figurative painting. The book also includes more than 350 selected images to inspire and guide the readers eye.</p><p>Rolina van Vliet has studied at the Academy of Physical Education in Groningen, the teacher training department of Amsterdam College, and the fine arts department at the Free Academy in The Hague. She now teaches at various centres for artistic training, and has developed a new method of painting based on abstract painting. Her work varies from abstract expressionism to lyrical abstract painting, with the emphasis on spontaneity and dynamics, and with a clear preference for total abstraction. She regularly exhibits her work, has written articles for art magazines and runs workshops and courses on abstract art.Oct 13 A handbook for all artists, from amateurs to professionals, students to teachers. Rolina takes an in-depth look at the practical nature of painting abstracts and includes over 350 images detailing the techniques and textures she uses. There is comprehensive information on how to get started and how to structure your work, colour-mixing techniques, working with acrylics as oil and as watercolours, creating texture and dynamic elements, adding details, relief and background techniques, and mixing media. If you are keen to move your abstract work forward, this is certainly one for you. * Leisure Painter, The * Sept 13 Following on from her other two successful books from the same publisher, Rolina shows 50 studies, demonstrating a wide variety of techniques. The paintings include different media such as oil pastel, acrylic, collage, chalk, gels and how to include sand, text and print in your work. 350 images show work in progress and finished work. This book is a way to build your own visual language following the studies, tips and techniques. Each study involves a task and one or more techniques. Learn how to incorporate texture. This book is for anyone who loves to play with paint. Explore the ideas that speak to you or work through the techniques one by one. Experimentation is a good way to develop your work. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * Aug 13 Previous books on abstraction by Rolina van Vliet have proved very popular and brought the art of non-representational painting to a wide audience. This new title is arranged as a course and is well-structured, with a series of deconstructed studies on specific techniques - including textures, knifework, gels or collage. In her introduction Rolina emphasises the need to develop technical skills in order to learn a visual language and this is very much the focus of the book. This differentiates it from other works on abstraction that tend to focus on the creative aspects of the style. It makes a valuable addition to any library and is as much a celebration as a guide. * Artist, The * Aug 13 Show me an abstract book and I&#39;ll bang on about how the style is as much about a state of mind as it is about techniques. I&#39;ll also say that the skills you need are mostly the ones you already have. Am I about to contradict myself, then? Well, no. Paint is paint, brushes are brushes and they all do what they do. However, there is a certain shorthand that can help in the ultimate aim of abstract painting, which is to make your viewer feel the same as you do about what you saw. This means that shapes and colours become pre-eminent, but you can also use textures to emphasise them and draw the viewer into and around the image in a particular way. The contents list includes terms like Negative Line, Textile Texture and Sketching Using Liquid Paint. Telling you this tells you the facts, but it doesn&#39;t tell you how it all works and you really have to see it to get the idea. The book itself is arranged as a series of studies (being neither demonstrations nor deconstructions) which include several illustrations, notes and a work sequence. I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d necessarily want to follow one through, or that you&#39;re meant to. If you&#39;re already a fan of abstraction, then this is the next logical step. * Artbookreview.net *</p><h2>Christine</h2><p>A scarlet-and-white, 1958 Plymouth fury--salvaged over every rational dissent and objection, from decay--possesses its new owner and brings hellish terror to him, his friends, and his classmates</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

His eyes were bulging from behind his steel-rimmed glasses, he had plastered one hand over his face so that his palm was partially cupping his mouth, and his neck could have been on ball-bearings the way he was craning back over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop the car, Dennis! Go back!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go back, I want to look at her again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly I understood. &#x201c;Oh, man, forget it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you mean that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thing we just passed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go back!&#x201d; He was almost screaming.<br> <br>I went back, thinking that it was maybe one of Arnie&#x2019;s subtle little jokes. But it wasn&#x2019;t. He was gone, lock, stock, and barrel. Arnie had fallen in love.<br> <br>She was a bad joke, and what Arnie saw in her that day I&#x2019;ll never know. The left side of her windshield was a snarled spiderweb of cracks. The right rear deck was bashed in, and an ugly nest of rust had grown in the paint-scraped valley. The back bumper was askew, the trunk-lid was ajar, and upholstery was bleeding out through several long tears in the seat covers, both front and back. It looked as if someone had worked on the upholstery with a knife. One tire was flat. The others were bald enough to show the canvas cording. Worst of all, there was a dark puddle of oil under the engine block.<br> <br>Arnie had fallen in love with a 1958 Plymouth Fury, one of the long ones with the big fins. There was an old and sun-faded FOR SALE sign propped on the right side of the windshield&#x2014;the side that was not cracked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at her lines, Dennis!&#x201d; Arnie whispered. He was running around the car like a man possessed. His sweaty hair flew and flopped. He tried the back door on the passenger side, and it came open with a scream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Arnie, you&#x2019;re having me on, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sunstroke, right? Tell me it&#x2019;s sunstroke. I&#x2019;ll take you home and put you under the frigging air conditioner and we&#x2019;ll forget all about this, okay?&#x201d; But I said it without much hope. He knew how to joke, but there was no joke on his face then. Instead, there was a kind of goofy madness I didn&#x2019;t like much.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t even bother to reply. A hot, stuffy billow of air, redolent of age, oil, and advanced decomposition, puffed out of the open door. Arnie didn&#x2019;t seem to notice that, either. He got in and sat down on the ripped and faded back seat. Once, twenty years before, it had been red. Now it was a faded wash pink.<br> <br>I reached in and pulled up a little puff of upholstery, looked at it, and blew it away. &#x201c;Looks like the Russian army marched over it on their way to Berlin,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He finally noticed I was still there. &#x201c;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeah. But she could be fixed up. She could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she could be tough. A moving unit, Dennis. A beauty. A real&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here! Here! What you two kids up to?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was an old guy who looked as if he was enjoying&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;his seventieth summer. Probably less. This particular dude struck me as the sort of man who enjoyed very little. His hair was long and scraggy, what little there was left of it. He had a good case of psoriasis going on the bald part of his skull.<br> <br>He was wearing green old man&#x2019;s pants and lowtopped Keds. No shirt; instead there was something cinched around his waist that looked like a lady&#x2019;s corset. When he got closer I saw it was a back brace. From the look of it I would say, just offhand, that he had changed it last somewhere around the time Lyndon Johnson died.<br> <br>&#x201c;What you kids up to?&#x201d; His voice was shrill and strident.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, is this your car?&#x201d; Arnie asked him. Not much question that it was. The Plymouth was parked on the lawn of the postwar tract house from which the old man had issued. The lawn was horrible, but it looked positively great with that Plymouth in the foreground for perspective.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if it is?&#x201d; The old guy demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x201d;&#x2014;Arnie had to swallow&#x2014;&#x201c;I want to buy it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old dude&#x2019;s eyes gleamed. The angry look on his face was replaced by a furtive gleam in the eye and a certain hungry sneer around the lips. Then a large resplendent shit-eating grin appeared. That was the moment, I think&#x2014;then, just at that moment&#x2014;when I felt something cold and blue inside me. There was a moment&#x2014;just then&#x2014;when I felt like slugging Arnie and dragging him away. Something came into the old man&#x2019;s eyes. Not just the gleam; it was something behind the gleam.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you should have said so,&#x201d; the old guy told Arnie. He stuck out his hand and Arnie took it. &#x201c;LeBay&#x2019;s the name. Roland D. LeBay. U.S. Army, retired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Arnie Cunningham.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old sport pumped his hand and sort of waved at me. I was out of the play; he had his sucker. Arnie might as well have handed LeBay his wallet.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; Arnie asked. And then he plunged ahead. &#x201c;Whatever you want for her, it&#x2019;s not enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned inside instead of sighing. His checkbook had just joined his wallet.<br> <br>For a moment LeBay&#x2019;s grin faltered a little, and his eyes narrowed down suspiciously. I think he was evaluating the possibility that he was being put on. He studied Arnie&#x2019;s open, longing face for signs of guile, and then asked the murderously perfect question:<br> <br>&#x201c;Son, have you ever owned a car before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He owns a Mustang Mach II,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;His folks bought it for him. It&#x2019;s got a Hurst shifter, a supercharger, and it can boil the road in first gear. It&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Arnie said quietly. &#x201c;I just got my driver&#x2019;s license this spring.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeBay tipped me a brief but crafty gaze and then swung his full attention back to his prime target. He put both hands in the small of his back and stretched. I caught a sour whiff of sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got a back problem in the Army,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Full disability. Doctors could never put it right. Anyone ever asks you what&#x2019;s wrong with the world, boys, you tell em it&#x2019;s three things: Doctors, commies, and nigger radicals. Of the three, commies is the worst, closely followed by doctors. And if they want to know who told you, tell em Roland D. LeBay. Yessir.&#x201d;<br> <br>He touched the old, scuffed hood of the Plymouth with a kind of bemused love.<br> <br>&#x201c;This here is the best car I ever owned. Bought her in September 1957. Back then, that&#x2019;s when you got your new model year, in September. All summer long they&#x2019;d show you pictures of cars under hoods and cars under tarps until you were fair dyin t&#x2019;know what they looked like underneath. Not like now.&#x201d; His voice dripped contempt for the debased times he had lived to see. &#x201c;Brand-new, she was. Had the smell of a brand-new car, and that&#x2019;s about the finest smell in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>He considered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Except maybe for pussy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at Arnie, nibbling the insides of my cheeks madly to keep from braying laughter all over everything. Arnie looked back at me, astounded. The old man appeared to notice neither of us; he was off on his own planet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was in khaki for thirty-four years,&#x201d; LeBay told us, still touching the hood of the car. &#x201c;Went in at sixteen in 1923. I et dust in Texas and seen crabs as big as lobsters in some o them Nogales whoredens. I saw men with their guts comin out their ears during Big Two. In France I saw that. Their guts was comin out their ears. You believe that, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; Arnie said. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d heard a word LeBay said. He was shifting from foot to foot as if he had to go to the bathroom bad. &#x201c;About the car, though&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You go to the University?&#x201d; LeBay barked suddenly. &#x201c;Up there at Horlicks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nosir, I go to Libertyville High.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; LeBay said grimly. &#x201c;Steer clear of colleges. They&#x2019;re full of niggerlovers that want to give away the Panama Canal. &#x2018;Think-tanks,&#x2019; they call em. &#x2018;Asshole-tanks,&#x2019; say I.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gazed fondly at the car sitting on its flat tire, its paintjob mellowing rustily in the late afternoon sunlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurt my back in the spring of &#x2019;57,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Army was going to rack and ruin even then. I got out just in time. I came on back to Libertyville. Looked over the rolling iron. I took my time. Then I walked into Norman Cobb&#x2019;s Plymouth dealership&#x2014;where the bowling alley is now on outer Main Street&#x2014;and I ordered this here car. I said you get it in red and white, next year&#x2019;s model. Red as a fire-engine on the inside. And they did it. When I got her, she had a total of six miles on the odometer. Yessir.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spat.<br> <br>I glanced over Arnie&#x2019;s shoulder at the odometer. The glass was cloudy, but I could read the damage all the same: 97,432. And six-tenths. Jesus wept.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you love the car so much, why are you selling it?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>He turned a milky, rather frightening gaze on me. &#x201c;Are you cracking wise on me, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t answer, but I didn&#x2019;t drop my gaze either.<br> <br>After a few moments of eye-to-eye duelling (which Arnie totally ignored; he was running a slow and loving hand over one of the back fins), he said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t drive anymore. Back&#x2019;s gotten too bad. Eyes are going the same way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly I got it&#x2014;or thought I did. If he had given us the correct dates, he was seventy-one. And at seventy, this state makes you start taking compulsory eye exams every year before they&#x2019;ll renew your driver&#x2019;s license. LeBay had either failed his eye exam or was afraid of failing. Either way, it came to the same thing. Rather than submit to that indignity, he had put the Plymouth up. And after that, the car had gotten old fast.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much do you want for it?&#x201d; Arnie asked again. Oh, he just couldn&#x2019;t wait to be slaughtered.<br> <br>LeBay turned his face up to the sky, appearing to consider it for rain. Then he looked down at Arnie again and gave him a large, kindly smile that was far too much like the previous shit-eating grin for me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking three hundred,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you seem a likely enough lad. I&#x2019;ll make it two-fifty for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my Christ,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>But he knew who his sucker was, and he knew exactly how to drive the wedge in between us. In the words of my grandfather, he hadn&#x2019;t fallen off a haytruck yesterday.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said brusquely. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s how you want it. I got my four-thirty story to watch. Edge of Night. Never miss it if I can help it. Nice chinning with you boys. So long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Arnie threw me such a smoking look of pain and anger that I backed off a step. He went after the old man and took his elbow. They talked. I couldn&#x2019;t hear it all, but I could see more than enough. The old man&#x2019;s pride was wounded. Arnie was earnest and apologetic. The old man just hoped Arnie understood that he couldn&#x2019;t stand to see the car that had brought him through safe to his golden years insulted. Arnie agreed. Little by little, the old man allowed himself to be led back. And again I felt something consciously dreadful about him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was as if a cold November wind could think. I can&#x2019;t put it any better than that.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he says one more word, I wash my hands of the whole thing,&#x201d; LeBay said, and cocked a horny, callused thumb at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t, he won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Arnie said hastily. &#x201c;Three hundred, did you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I believe that was&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-fifty was the quoted price,&#x201d; I said loudly.<br> <br>Arnie looked stricken, afraid the old man would walk away again, but LeBay was taking no chances. The fish was almost out of the pond now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-fifty would do it, I guess,&#x201d; LeBay allowed. He glanced my way again, and I saw that we had an understanding&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t like me and I didn&#x2019;t like him.<br> <br>To my ever-increasing horror, Arnie pulled his wallet out and began thumbing through it. There was silence among the three of us. LeBay looked on. I looked away at a little kid who was trying to kill himself on a puke-green skateboard. Somewhere a dog barked. Two girls who looked like eighth-or ninth-graders went past, giggling and holding clutches of library books to their blooming chests. I had only one hope left for getting Arnie out of this; it was the day before payday. Given time, even twenty-four hours, this wild fever might pass. Arnie was beginning to remind me of Toad, of Toad Hall.<br> <br>When I looked back, Arnie and LeBay were looking at two fives and six ones&#x2014;all that had been in his wallet, apparently.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a check?&#x201d; Arnie asked.<br> <br>LeBay offered Arnie a dry smile and said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good check,&#x201d; Arnie protested. It would be, too. We had been working all summer for Carson Brothers on the I-376 extension, the one which natives of the Pittsburgh area firmly believe will never be really finished. Arnie sometimes declared that Penn-DOT had begun taking bids on the I-376 work shortly after the Civil War ended. Not that either of us had any right to complain; a lot of kids were either working for slave wages that summer or not working at all. We were making good money, even clocking some overtime. Brad Jeffries, the job foreman, had been frankly dubious about taking a kid like Arnie on, but had finally allowed that he could use a flagman; the girl he had been planning to hire had gotten herself pregnant and had run off to get married. So Arnie had started off flagging in June but had gotten into the harder work little by little, running mostly on guts and determination. It was the first real job he&#x2019;d ever had, and he didn&#x2019;t want to screw it up. Brad was reasonably impressed, and the summer sun had even helped Arnie&#x2019;s erupting complexion a little. Maybe it was the ultraviolet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s a good check, son,&#x201d; LeBay said, &#x201c;but I gotta make a cash deal. You understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know if Arnie understood, but I did. It would be too easy to stop payment on a local check if this rustbucket Plymouth threw a rod or blew a piston on the way home.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call the bank,&#x201d; Arnie said, starting to sound desperate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; LeBay said, scratching his armpit above the scabrous brace. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going on five-thirty. Bank&#x2019;s long since closed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A deposit, then,&#x201d; Arnie said, and held out the sixteen dollars. He looked positively wild. It may be that you&#x2019;re having trouble believing a kid who was almost old enough to vote could have gotten himself so worked up over an anonymous old clunk in the space of fifteen minutes. I was having some trouble believing it myself. Only Roland D. LeBay seemed not to be having trouble with it, and I supposed it was because at his age he had seen everything. It was only later that I came to believe that his odd sureness might come from other sources. Either way, if any milk of human kindness had ever run in his veins, it had curdled to sour cream long ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to have at least ten percent down,&#x201d; LeBay said. The fish was out of the water; in a moment it would be netted. &#x201c;If I had ten percent, I&#x2019;d hold her for twenty-four hours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dennis,&#x201d; Arnie said. &#x201c;Can you loan me nine bucks until tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had twelve in my own wallet, and no particular place to go. Day after day of spreading sand and digging trenches for culverts had done wonders when it came to getting ready for football practice, but I had no social life at all. Lately I hadn&#x2019;t even been assaulting the ramparts of my cheerleader girlfriend&#x2019;s body in the style to which she had become accustomed. I was rich but lonely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on over here and let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>LeBay&#x2019;s brow darkened, but he could see he was stuck with my input, like it or not. His frizzy white hair blew back and forth in the mild breeze. He kept one hand possessively on the Plymouth&#x2019;s hood.<br> <br>Arnie and I walked back toward where my car, a &#x2019;75 Duster, was parked at the curb. I put an arm around Arnie&#x2019;s shoulders. For some reason I remembered the two of us up in his room on a rainy fall day...</p><h2>American Literature, 2nd Edition</h2><p>American Literature Student Text introduces your students to more than seventy authors in a study that connects the authors&#39; lives and beliefs as revealed in their writings with the corresponding literary periods.

Additional text discusses the unique features of each variety and is illustrated with either a photograph of the tree, flowers, or leaves. Supplementary material includes a &#x201c;Factfile,&#x201d; which has illustrations of tree, leaf, flower, and fruit shapes, and small maps showing the types and major forests of the world. There are also four pages of charts describing the largest families and genera of trees. The volume concludes with a short glossary and an index. The text is clear and written in nontechnical language.

(<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br> With a narrative that "is as clear-eyed and cold-blooded as her hero" <i>(The New Yorker)</i>, Julia Leigh depicts the hunt for the last known Tasmanian tiger by a man identified only as M, who wants to find the creature for a multinational biotech company. Tracking M's fateful course, beginning at a remote house on the fringe of a vast wilderness and receding into the forest-a world of silence and stillness-The Hunter is a haunting tale of obsession and redemption. It is the story of a business proposition that takes on mythic aspects, as the quest for a nearly extinct animal becomes a search not for ultimate profit but for the essence of life that technology has all but crushed.</p><p>Julia Leigh is the author of two internationally acclaimed novels, THE HUNTER (1999) and DISQUIET (2008). Her film SLEEPING BEAUTY was selected for Competition at the Festival de Cannes 2011. She lives in Sydney, Australia.Already a hit in Australia, Leigh's flawed but exciting debut describes the deadly search for the fabled, and perhaps extinct, Tasmanian tiger, aka the thylacine. A mysterious man who is identified to the reader only as M assumes the identity of "Martin David, naturalist" and arrives at the filthy, disheveled house of depressed Lucy Armstrong, whose husband, Jarrah, a naturalist and bioethics expert, recently disappeared on the plateau. Lucy's home becomes the base for M's treks into the wilderness, ostensibly to study the habits of Tasmanian devils. In fact, and in secret, M works for a biotech company. His mission: to secure genetic material from what may be the world's last remaining thylacine, reportedly sighted on the plateau. M must hide his true occupation from Lucy and her lonely children, Sass and Bike, as well as from the National Parks researchers and the suspicious local townspeople. Sydney-based Leigh shifts ably between M's laconic narration and third-person storytelling. With the exception of a superfluous (and clumsily handled) romantic subplot, the novel's events are compelling, drawing the reader deep into M's inner jungle. Leigh is most effective when writing in M's voice, exploring his relationship to the wilderness, his tracking expertise and his ability "to think like a true and worthy predator." Fans of Peter Matthiessen will find Leigh darker and sometimes less ambitious, but effective in similar ways, as M's obsession with the hunt drives this moody work by a gifted new author to its chilling conclusion.

Where had they gone? Why couldn't she hear their sweet voices? Why didn't their footsteps echo throughout the house?</i><br><br><i>Was it him? Had he done something to her babies?</i><br><br><i>The thought of it broke her heart and she screamed in anguish, vowing never to rest until her children were returned to her.</i><br><br><i>And until the man paid.</i><br><br>Danae LeBeau was running late, as usual, but today she had a good excuse. The local radio station had been abuzz since the wee hours of the morning, broadcasting information about the attack on Alaina LeBeau weeks before and the subsequent death of her attacker at the hands of the local sheriff. Until now, it had all been gossip and speculation, while everyone impatiently waited for the state police to clear those involved and declare it self-defense. Now it was the hottest bit of excitement the tiny bayou town of Calais had ever seen. <i>My sister could have died.</i><br><br>The thought ripped through her as she listened to the reporter relay the gruesome details of that horrible night at their mother's estate, the weight of the words crippling her. Her sister could have died, and Danae had never even told her they were related.<br><br>After their mother's death, the three sisters had been separated by their stepfather, Trenton Purcell, and shipped off to be raised by distant relatives. Danae was only two when it happened, not old enough to remember anything about her life in Calais. The only childhood she'd known was in California, but years ago, she'd started slowly making her way across the country to Louisiana. Even though she couldn't remember anything about her life in Calais, she'd always felt a tug&#x2014;as if something was drawing her back to her birthplace.<br><br>Using an assumed name, she'd taken a job at the local cafe to try to find out information on her stepfather, who had lived as a recluse in her mother's family estate for over two decades. But she'd managed to find out very little about the man, given that most of the townspeople seemed to completely dislike him and were happy to see him disappear from society.<br><br>After her stepfather's death, Danae's sister Alaina showed up in Calais to meet the terms of their mother's will. According to the local gossip, each sister was required to live on the estate for a period of two weeks within one year after their stepfather's death. Once those stipulations were met, their mother's estate would pass to the sisters. It was shocking news to Danae, who'd always assumed their mother had left everything to their stepfather and that her ties to Calais had long since been severed.<br><br>Danae still remembered the day Alaina arrived in town. Through the storefront window of the cafe, she'd seen Alaina driving her SUV down Main Street. She'd dropped a whole stack of dishes and had her pay docked for the incident, but she hadn't been able to help it. The only thing Danae had from her past was an old photo of their mother. Alaina looked as if she'd stepped out of that photo, changed into current clothes and driven by.<br><br>When she met Alaina early one morning at the cafe, Danae wanted to tell her that they were sisters, but years of living on the street had taught her to always stand back and assess the situation. To always limit exposure of herself unless absolutely necessary. That level of caution had saved her life more than once, and just because she experienced a familial pull, she had no reason to sacrifice something that had always worked for her.<br><br>But now, she wondered if she should reveal herself. From the local talk, she had a good idea about the terms of the will and knew that if she wanted to take part, she'd have to come forward. The distant cousin who had taken her in when her mother died had passed away long ago, a liquor bottle clenched in her leathered hand, and Danae had never gotten close enough to anyone to make lasting friendships. If anyone tried to find her, the trail stopped cold in California.<br><br>After Danae met Alaina and got a good feeling about her as a person, she'd been tempted to talk to the estate attorney, but she'd still held back. What if their middle sister couldn't be located, either? Her understanding was that all three sisters had to meet the requirements of the will in order for any of them to inherit. If the last sister couldn't be located or didn't agree to the terms, then Danae would have exposed herself for no viable reason, and at a time when she didn't feel comfortable doing so.<br><br>But the attack on Alaina had her rethinking everything. What if her sister had died and she'd never gotten the chance to tell her who she was? She could have missed one of her only opportunities to have a real family.<br><br>As she grabbed her car keys, she glanced at her watch and cursed. She even had the advantage of working second shift that morning, but she wasn't going to make the later work time, either. Johnny, the cafe owner, was going to kill her for being so late. Likely, everyone in Calais would wander through the cafe this morning to gossip about the news report. Nothing this big had ever happened in the sleepy bayou town. It was going to be the talk for quite a while.<br><br>She flung open the front door of her rented cabin, ready to break some major speeding laws on the winding country roads, but stopped short at the sight of the plain white envelope that lay on the welcome mat.<br><br>Such a common, nonthreatening item shouldn't have set off the wave of anxiety that flooded through her, but she immediately knew something was off. She hadn't let her guard down long enough to make close friends, and even if she had, they would hardly drive ten miles into the swamp to leave an envelope at her doorstep.<br><br>Her hands shook as she reached for the envelope, and as soon as her fingers closed around it, she set off at a run for her car. Whoever had left the envelope might be watching, lurking somewhere in the swamp that enclosed the tiny cabin and blocked it off from the rest of the world.<br><br>She jumped into her ancient sedan, started it and threw it into Drive, tearing out of the dirt driveway before she'd even managed to close the car door. She pressed the accelerator just beyond the limits of safety, and her fingers ached from clenching the steering wheel as the old car skidded in the gravel. The narrow road seemed to stretch on forever, but finally, she reached the intersection for the paved road that led into Calais.<br><br>She pulled to a stop and looked over at the envelope that she'd tossed onto the passenger's seat. Habit had her checking her rearview mirror, but no one was visible behind her. She glanced back at the passenger's seat where the envelope lay, seemingly taunting her to open it. Lifting one hand, she bit her lower lip, then hesitated.<br><br><i>What are you&#x2014;a coward?</i><br><br>Unable to stand it any longer, she grabbed the envelope and tore it open. A single scrap of paper containing only one sentence fell out into her hand.<br><br>I know who you are.<br><br>She sucked in a breath so hard her chest ached. All her careful planning and secrecy had been for naught. Someone had figured out her secret. But why did they leave this message? What were they hoping to accomplish by doing so? Being Ophelia LeBeau's daughter wasn't a crime, and Danae had no reason other than an overzealous sense of self-protection for hiding her true identity.<br><br>Someone must be trying to scare her. But to what end?<br><br>She shoved the paper into her purse and continued her drive to town. She'd stop at the cafe first and let Johnny know she had to take a bit more time that morning. He wouldn't be happy and may even fire her, but that couldn't be helped. Danae had the sudden overwhelming feeling that she had to find William Duhon, the estate attorney, and reveal her true identity.<br><br>Whatever someone hoped to accomplish with the note, she was going to cut them off at the pass.<br><br>Danae spotted Alaina's SUV in front of the attorney's office and felt another bout of panic. Then logic took over and she decided it was a good thing. Might as well kill two birds with one stone. She hurried into the office and told a rather grim-looking woman at the front desk that she wished to speak to Mr. Duhon.<br><br>The grim woman frowned, which surprised Danae a bit, as she'd thought the woman was already frowning before.<br><br>"Do you have an appointment?" Grim asked.<br><br>"You know that I don't," Danae replied, trying to keep her voice level. After all, this woman and everyone else knew her as Connie from the cafe, and probably couldn't imagine why she'd need to speak to William.<br><br>"I can make you an appointment for later this week."<br><br>"Is he talking to Alaina?"<br><br>"Mr. Duhon's clients are all afforded the privacy they deserve&#x2014;"<br><br>Danae waved a hand at the woman to cut her off.<br><br>"Never mind," she said as she walked past the desk and pushed open the door to the attorney's office.<br><br>Alaina jumped around in her seat when Danae flung open the door, and the attorney jumped up from his chair, uncertain and clearly uncomfortable with the interruption.<br><br>"You can't go in there," Grim admonished behind her.<br><br>"I'm Danae LeBeau," she said before she could change her mind.<br><br>Alaina and William stared at her, their expressions a mixture of disbelief and surprise. She'd expected as much. Connie Smith, cafe waitress, had served them both breakfast on many occasions. She'd never provided her real name to anyone in Calais before now. And as her looks were a perfect blend of both parents, she didn't favor either enough to draw suspicion.<br><br>"I have documentation," she said and pulled some faded, worn papers from her purse. "A birth certificate and a driver's license with my real name&#x2014;I'd appreciate it if you don't ask where I got the one I've been using."<br><br>She stood there, holding the documents, with both William and Alaina staring at her in shock. Finally, Alaina rose from her chair and walked the couple of steps to stand in front of her.<br><br>"Danae?" Alaina said, her voice wavering. "You were just a toddler... You had on a new dress that day&#x2014;"<br><br>"Yellow with white roses," Danae interrupted.<br><br>Alaina's eyes filled with tears. "Yes." She threw her arms around Danae and squeezed her tightly. "I never thought... When I came here, I didn't know what would happen."<br><br>Danae struggled to maintain her composure. "I didn't know, either."<br><br>"Why didn't you tell me when I first arrived?"<br><br>"We're fine, Ms. Morgan," William's voice sounded behind them.<br><br>Danae released Alaina and glanced back in time to see Secretary Grim pull the door closed, her frown still fixed in place. Alaina smiled at her and wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand.<br><br>"I...uh..." Danae struggled to find a way to explain. "I don't really know why I came to Calais, or even to Louisiana. I mean, I guess I thought I could talk to our stepfather and maybe find out something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;about my past, maybe find you and Joelle. But I never got the chance and then he died."<br><br>Danae sniffed and willed the tears that were building to stay in place. Now was not the time to go soft. "I don't really remember. I don't remember anything, and I kept thinking that it was important. That my life here mattered and I needed to know. I know it sounds silly..."<br><br>Alaina squeezed her arm. "No. It doesn't sound silly at all. Not to me."<br><br>Danae could tell by the way Alaina said it that she meant what she said. She wasn't just being nice. She understood, as only the three sisters could possibly understand. A wave of relief passed over her, and the tug at her heart, the one she'd felt for Alaina the first time she saw her, grew stronger.<br><br>"I'm sure you've heard about how our stepfather lived," Danae continued. "I never even saw him. Then he died and you turned up."<br><br>Alaina smiled. "I felt a connection to you when we first met that I didn't understand. I slipped so easily into conversation with you, which is rare. Maybe somewhere deep down, I knew."<br><br>Danae sniffed and her eyes misted up a bit. "I wanted to say something when you arrived, but what would people think&#x2014;my working here with an assumed name and all?"<br><br>She looked over at the attorney. "I swear I didn't know about the inheritance when I came to Calais."<br><br>The attorney waved a hand at the chairs in front of his desk, encouraging them to sit. "Please don't trouble yourself with those kinds of thoughts, Ms. LeBeau. You couldn't have been aware of the conditions of your mother's will. Ophelia was a very private person, and your stepfather wasn't about to tell anyone that he wasn't really the wealthy man he seemed."<br><br>As Danae slid into the chair next to Alaina, she felt some of the tension lessen in her shoulders and back. "But I still came here under false pretenses."<br><br>"No," Alaina said. "You came here looking for answers and didn't want everyone to know that evil old man was your stepfather. I hardly think anyone will fault you for your feelings."<br><br>The attorney nodded. "Your sister is correct. While some of the more dramatic of Calais's residents may find some fun in theorizing as to your hidden identity, those who partake in logical thinking will not so much as raise an eyebrow at your choices. In fact, most would assume you wise."<br><br>Danae smiled. "You're very refreshing, Mr. Duhon."<br><br>"Isn't he the best?" Alaina beamed. "Until I met him, I had no idea attorneys could be competent, nice and have a personality. I'd thought I was the only one."<br><br>"Please call me William," he said, a slight blush creeping up his neck. "Well, ladies, we have a lot to discuss, but I can cover the basics of the inheritance now and we can meet at a later date to discuss the rest."</p><h2>The Art of Soaring</h2><p>When first published, &#34;The Art of Soaring&#34; stayed at the top of Russian bestseller lists for a whole year.

Divided into broad subjects ("The Age of Ancient Life," "Armored Dinosaurs," etc.), which are again subdivided ("The Burgess Shale," "Triassic animals," etc.), the book focuses on dinosaurs, but provides a broad spectrum of other life-forms and the evolutionary landscapes in which they lived. With a longer and more cohesive text than David Lambert's Dinosaur Encyclopedia (DK, 2001), this volume demands a more concentrated effort to read. However, Burnie's style is quite approachable and should prove no problem to determined dinophiles. A time line across the tops of relevant pages allows easy placement in time of referenced animals. The numerous illustrations are colorful and inviting; color photos are used where possible. Diagrams include such disparate subjects as a stegosaurian nervous system and a cladogram of advanced therapods (the sole mention of cladistics in the book, other than the glossary). Theories on dinosaur endothermia, the cause of mass extinctions, and the course of bird evolution are included. Though a list of Web sites is given, no further readings are suggested, and no bibliographic/source notes are provided. More demanding and more up-to-date than Dougal Dixon's The Macmillan Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals (1988), this new fodder for budding paleontologists will be met with pleased approbation.<br><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Baksheesh and Brahman: Asian Journals - India (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)</h2><p>After ten years of intensive study of Indian art and philosophy, Joseph Campbell, at 50, finally embarked on a journey to India. Searching for the transcendent (Brahman), he found instead stark realities: growing nationalism, religious rivalry, poverty, and a prevalent culture of what he called baksheesh,&#x201d; or alms. This journal chronicles the disillusionment and revelation that would change the course of Campbell&#x2019;s life and study, and his transition from professor to counterculture icon. Balancing Campbell&#x2019;s astute explorations of mythology and history are his often amusing observations of a sometimes frustrating alien culture and his fellow Western travelers. This account also includes personal photographs, specially commissioned maps, and illustrations redrawn from Campbell&#x2019;s own hand.</p><p>Years before he became a mythology expert and household name, Joseph Campbell journeyed to India. He was nearly 50, at a career crossroads, and after 10 years studying Indian art and philosophy he was finally going to India seeking the transcendent (Brahman), the mysteries of India. Instead he found the stark realities of baksheesh culture. His journal of those six months is the closest Campbell ever came to an autobiography. It&#39;s a diary of his adventures, insights, and ponderings; it&#39;s a window into the India of 1954 and the Joseph Campbell of 1954--both are intriguing places to visit.The personal journal of the renowned mythologist Joseph Campbell during his year of travel in Asia in the fifties, enhanced by more than 60 previously unpublished photographs, specially commissioned maps, and illustrations redrawn from Campbell&#39;s own hand.</p><h2>Miami, U.S.A. (Florida History and Culture)</h2><p><p>"The best book ever written on Miami."--<i>Tampa Tribune</i></p><p>"A breezy, friendly history of Greater Miami from its days as a trading post to the present era."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p><br>Helen Muir&#x2019;s affectionate account of Miami first appeared in 1953 and has grown through several revisions into the definitive popular history of a remarkable city. Marjory Stoneman Douglas, writing for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, called the first edition "vigorous, colorful, dramatic, variously detailed, jam-packed with people, fast moving, a seething document. . . . Helen Muir threads her way vividly and surely through the tangles of modern crime, pretensions, and scandals, but also shows Miami growing enormously as an intellectual and cultural focus."</p><p>In the decades since, change has roared through Miami like a hurricane, and Helen Muir, at 89, remains active in the city&#x2019;s cultural and intellectual life.</p><p>Updating this new edition through the 1990s, Muir brings the story of the frontier post transformed by Flagler, Tuttle, and a host of near-legendary figures and events to a new century of readers. To those who reflect on Muir&#x2019;s colorful epilogue, the city&#x2019;s primitive origins barely 100 years ago will seem improbable, the characters and events of its boom, crash, and war years astonishing, and the pace of its growth and transformation since that time barely believable.</p><p>Helen Muir first came to Miami in 1934 and has written for the <i>Miami News, Miami Herald, Saturday Evening Post, Nation&#x2019;s Business</i>, and <i>Woman&#x2019;s Day</i>. In 1999 she was honored as Chairperson Emeritus of the Library Advisory Board for&nbsp; honoring her continued efforts on behalf of the Miami-Dade Public Library system; she was also listed on the American Library Association/American Library Trustee Association Advocates Honor Roll 2000.&nbsp; She was inducted into the Florida Women&#x2019;s Hall of Fame in 1984. She is the author of <i>Frost in Florida: A Memoir</i> and <i>The Biltmore: Beacon for Miami</i>.</p></p><p>Helen Muir was inducted into the Florida Women&#39;s Hall of Fame and received the Trustee Citation of the American Library Association.In this handsome updated edition which brings back to print a 1953 title, environmental journalist Muir reviews in broad strokes and anecdote-studded prose the turbulent last four decades for Miami, stressing the heterogeneity that has given the city its unique character. The author observes the encroachments of big business, the military and retirees on Miami's neighborhoods. She investigates the teeming street life of refugees, most notably Cubans who have turned Miami into the "capital of South America," enriching the city but also contributing to racial tension and drug-related crime. The book should have wide local appeal.

A prolific author of novels, poetry and biography, Warner's mastery of her art remains exemplary in its powerful complexity, its finely honed, unsentimental perceptiveness and immediacy of description, deep sensitivity and literate, graceful style. Many of the stories (written between 1932 and 1977) are set in English villages and focus on middle-aged protagonists often enduring rather than transcending their ostensibly unremarkable lives, confronting losses and botched opportunities and sometimes breaking out of bounds to manifest themselves. But Warner can as well evoke the feelings of a young German soldier fighting for Fascism in Spain, or a devout Mexican pastry-cook. Occasionally the author's wicked wit flattens her characters and makes her stories reductive, yet her mastery of her craft sustains their quality. The collection ends with extracts from her autobiographical writings and the magical Kingdoms of Elfin , cruel fairy tales about mortality and aging, which manifest her protean imagination and powerfully celebrate the natural world viewed with a clear, unsparing eye. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Warner is always rewarding, and here even more so because these 47 stories, chosen from her prolific output, illustrate her varied capacity to create fictional worlds, whether magical, humorous, realistic, romantic, or historical. Especially distinctive is her consistent attention to hundreds of background details that infuse each character, each situation with believability and delight. Warner's short stories have justifiably earned her a foremost status in contemporary literature, and this selection is a judicious introduction to her extraordinary talent which encompasses poetry, biography, and full-length fiction as well.

Suddenly Ursula finds herself at the center of the scandal, trying to protect Elizabeth as she loses her heart to a Frenchman who may be flirting with sedition against her Queen. She can trust no one, neither her lover nor her monarch, as she sets out to find the truth in a glittering court that conceals a wellspring of blood and lies.</p><p><b>Fiona Buckley</b> is the author of eight historical mystery novels featuring Ursula Blanchard: <i>To Shield the Queen, The Doublet Affair, Queen's Ransom, To Ruin a Queen, Queen of Ambition, A Pawn for a Queen, The Fugitive Queen</i>, and <i>The Siren Queen</i>.

After the Germans invaded Norway, many Norwegians knew that small boats were constantly sailing from the Shetland Islands to land weapons, supplies, and agents and to rescue refugees. In The Shetland Bus, David Howarth, who was second in command of the Shetland base, recounts the hundreds of trips made by fishing boats in the dark of Arctic winter to resist the Nazi onslaught. For the Norwegians who remained in Norway, the Shetland Bus&#x2015;as this dangerous operation became known&#x2015;fortified them both physically and spiritually. Nothing but war would have made seamen attempt such dangerous journeys. Some stretched two thousand miles in length and lasted as long as three weeks in boats only fifty to seventy-five feet long. Fishing boats crossing the North Sea were sometimes attacked and sunk in minutes, hundreds of miles from a friendly ship or shore. Their crews had no hope of being saved. But to &#x201c;take the Shetland Bus&#x201d; meant escape when capture became the only other option. The Shetland Bus is the amazing true-life account of storms, attacks, danger, and the heroic efforts of brave men.<p>David Howarth ran a spy ring during World War II from which this book was derived. Mr. Howarth, who died in 1991, was the author of two dozen major books of history.</p></p><h2>Ed King</h2><p>A sweeping, propulsive, darkly humorous new novel by the best-selling author of <i>Snow Falling on Cedars: </i>a story of destiny, desire, and destruction that reimagines Sophocles&#x2019;s <i>Oedipus Rex</i> for our own era.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Seattle in 1962, Walter Cousins, a mild-mannered actuary&#x2014;&#x201c;a guy who weighs risk for a living&#x201d;&#x2014;takes a risk of his own, and makes the biggest error of his life.

She was an English exchange student named Diane Burroughs, and he was an actuary at Piersall-Crane, Inc., whose wife, that summer, had suffered a nervous breakdown. Diane had been in his house for less than a week&#x2014;mothering his kids, cleaning, making meals&#x2014;when he noticed a new word intruding on his assessment of her. &#x2018;Here I am,&#x2019; thought Walter, &#x2018;an actuary, a guy who weighs risk for a living, and now, because I&#x2019;m infatuated with the wrong person&#x2014;because I&#x2019;m smitten by an 18 year old--I&#x2019;m using the word fate.&#x2019;<br><br>Diane had been peddled to Walter, by an office temp familiar with her current host family, as &#x201c;a nice girl from the U.K. who needs work to extend her visa.&#x201d; Walter, who at 34 had never left North America, thought &#x201c;au pair&#x201d; sounded pretentious&#x2014;&#x201c;you mean&nbsp; babysitter,&#x201d; he told the temp. Immediately he regretted his provincialism, so he added, &#x201c;I could also go with nanny.&#x201d; The temp&#x2019;s comeback was sharp. She was younger than he was, wore formidable boots, and had an air of immunity to an office flirt like Walter. &#x201c;No, definitely, it&#x2019;s au pair,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s here on a visa. She&#x2019;s from out of the country. If you take her on, you become her host father, and you give her an allowance for whatever she does for you&#x2014;child care or housework or whatever.&#x201d; <br><br>Au pair it was, then. Walter took down the phone number, chatted with Diane&#x2019;s host mother, then spoke to the girl herself. In no position to be picky--he needed help yesterday&#x2014;he hired Diane on the spot. <br><br>&#x201c;This is hard to explain,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d explained, &#x201c;but my wife&#x2019;s . . . hospitalized.&#x201d; <br><br>Back came the sort of English inflections it was difficult for him not to be charmed by. &#x201c;In hospital,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I do hope it isn&#x2019;t serious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but meanwhile there&#x2019;s the kids. Four and three. Barry and Tina. Out of diapers, but still, they&#x2019;re tricky to corral.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then allow me just a smidgeon of shameful self-promotion. What you need is an English au pair, sir, adept with a rodeo rope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you mean lasso.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lass with a lasso, then, for when they&#x2019;re mucking about starkers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I need. Something like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Diane. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m your girl.&#x201d;<br><br>This flagrantly forward use of language&#x2014;neat, cunning phrases and bald innuendo--from the mouth of a high school girl jockeying for work was new in his American ear. Diane sounded quick-witted and cheerfully combative--qualities he&#x2019;d always found winning and attractive--as in her screed on the U.S. State Department and its byzantine visa requirements. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still keen to go to college in America,&#x201d; she told him, &#x201c;but at the moment I&#x2019;m furious with your Seattle passport office. They&#x2019;re trying, actually, to throw me out.&#x201d;<br><br>The next Sunday, with his kids complaining in the back seat of his Lincoln Premiere, Walter went to escort this girl from her host family&#x2019;s large Victorian near Seward Park to his brick-veneered ranch house in Greenwood. He hoped Diane wouldn&#x2019;t be too disappointed when she discovered she was moving down in the world, and as he parked on the cobbles fronting the Victorian, he imagined himself apologizing for having nothing to offer in the way of gilding or ambience. Seward Park, after all, dripped old money and featured lake views; Greenwood, by contrast, was dowdy and decrepit, with summer-arid grass patches and sagging gutters. Walter, of course, would have liked a better neighborhood, but his was a notoriously mid-wage profession, a fact he hadn&#x2019;t reckoned with at Iowa State but was reckoning with now, too late. Not that it was bad at Piersall-Crane, where he held down a cubicle by a window. Walter took certain consolations there&#x2014;in collegial hobnobbing, in crisply dressed women, and in the higher realms of actuarial science, which for him had innate satisfactions. That the predictive power of numbers on a large scale could be brought to bear on future events&#x2014;for Walter, that was like an esoteric secret and, as he put it to himself, sort of mystical. Okay, it wasn&#x2019;t art or philosophy, but it was still deep, which almost no one understood.<br><br>When he first saw her, the au pair struck him, when he saw her first, as nowhere close to legal. She looked like a child, unfinished, a sprout--no hairdo or make-up, no jewelry, unadorned-- she looked like the younger sister of a girl he&#x2019;d dated long ago, in high school. Her abraded, leather suitcases, strapped and buckled, and riddled with tarnished rivets that looked shot from a machine gun&#x2014;a matched set, though one was a junior version of the other--waited for Walter on the porch. Propped on the clasp of the larger one was a transistor radio with an ivory plastic strap and ivory knobs. Feeling like a porter&#x2014;but also like a honeymooner--he hauled her over-stuffed luggage to the Lincoln&#x2019;s trunk while Diane, in dungarees, doled out last minute hugs and delivered farewells in her disarming accent. &#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; he heard her say. &#x201c;Perfect.&#x201d; Then he held the car door wide for her, and when she turned, brightly, to greet his kids in the back seat, he looked, surreptitiously, down the gap that opened between the rear waist of her dungarees and the nether regions of her back, at the shadow there, the practical white undies, and the reddish down along her tailbone.<br><br>It was so&#x2014;you never knew; you couldn&#x2019;t predict. Not even an actuary knew what would happen&#x2014;there were broad trends, of course, he could express in tables, but individual destinies were always nebulous. In Walter&#x2019;s case, this meant his wife was out of the house while he, against the odds, on a fair summer morning, was collecting up this enticing piece of luck to install in the bedroom across the hall from his. How had this dangerous but fortuitous thing happened? What had he done to deserve this risk? With these questions and her underwear in mind, he chose, as his route, Lake Washington Boulevard; there might be, he sensed, an intangible benefit in such a sinuous and scenic drive. He also decided to take all 3 kids to the booming, newly opened Seattle World&#x2019;s Fair, because in its context he could function like a grandee, bestowing cotton candy and largesse, before introducing Diane to Greenwood. With this plan in mind, he motored past pleasure craft and magnificent trees while, on the passenger side, twined hands in her lap, Diane answered questions, ingratiated herself skillfully and easily to his offspring, and brought to his mind the pert and perfect Hayley Mills, that upbeat, full-lipped, earnest starlet who, on the cover of <i>Life</i> recently, in a sailor outfit, had puckered, naughtily, for a kiss. In fact, as Diane chatted up his progeny in lilting tones but with a teasing irony that, over their heads, might be aimed at him, she was a drop-dead ringer for the 16 year old Disney darling who&#x2019;d been in newspapers and magazines lately for turning down the lead role in <i>Lolita</i>. A morsel, a nymphet, in frilly socks and Keds, a junior high date&#x2014;the beach walk, for sodas&#x2014;and at the kind of youthful sexual crest that even a 4 year old could sense. Sure enough, Barry, with a 4 year old&#x2019;s primal yearning, leaned over the front seat and settled his head on his hands, like a cherub posed for a Christmas portrait, the better to bask in Diane&#x2019;s nubile aura. Flicking 2 fingers against his bony shoulder, the object of his son&#x2019;s newly stirred affections chirped, as if on cue, &#x201c;I love your name, Barry, really I do. And Tina,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;is so lovely.&#x201d; After that, she shot Walter a look, and winked as though he, her new employer, was instead her intimate chauffeur.<br><br>&#x201c;You truly have great names,&#x201d; he tossed out.<br><br>&#x201c;Tiptop, the best, brilliant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Barry and Tina: it&#x2019;s genius, it&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>Diane, and then Walter, laughed.<br><br>And she laughed an hour later&#x2014;the same truncated notes, issued through her nose and throat--when, on the mammothly rising Space Wheel, they all rocked precariously in the apex tub, 90 feet above the mania of the fair grounds. She laughed because, taking hold of the lap bar, he&#x2019;d muscled them into rocking harder while Tina put up conflicted resistance (&#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d;) and Barry applied a grit-filled assist. &#x201c;Beastly!&#x201d; hissed Diane, pulling Tina toward her. &#x201c;Never mind such recklessness, love--he&#x2019;s only toying with your dear, precious life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But Tina absolutely adores danger. Don&#x2019;t you,&#x2018;luv&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br>To this his daughter had a one word reply, delivered while clutching the au pair&#x2019;s stellar thighs: &#x201c;Diane.&#x201d;<br><br>On the fairgrounds, Walter followed Diane like a dog, so he could admire how she wore those dungarees. There were a lot of bare-armed dresses on the midway, and peppermint tops, and circus stripes, but nothing that could beat Diane in dungarees. Nothing could beat Diane&#x2019;s tilting ponytail when she lifted her chin to pack in wads of cotton candy; nothing could beat her in the Fine Arts Pavilion with her lovely, little hands at the small of her back, leaning toward a painting called &#x201c;<i>Oedipus and the Sphinx.</i>&#x201d; Barry stood beside her with his head on her hip, and Walter stood alongside with Tina in his arms. The odd and slightly uncomfortable thing was that Oedipus had been painted monumentally naked--two spears, points down, beside one foot--while the Sphinx, half in darkness, winged and severe, pointed her bare breasts, from startling c...</p><h2>Supermemory: The Revolution</h2><p>An account of the capacity of human potential teaches readers how to accelerate learning power, enhance career performance, relieve stress and improve health</p><p></p><h2>The Games (Private, 6)</h2><p><b>In the #1 bestselling series, Private's Jack Morgan must hunt down a killer before the Olympic games begin in Rio.</b><br>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil knows how to throw a party.

The essay writers discuss Beaton's love of theatricality and artifice and its evidence in his style: subjects posed in period costume, shot against or reflected in mirrors, the photographer's own reflection visible in a photo, ironic and sometimes severely unflattering angles. Even his wartime photos have the oddly displaced quality of a stage set. The full-size color plates here are disappointingly few in number; the book's other sections are themselves well illustrated with photos, though these are smaller and black-and-white. Many of the same pictures also appear in Beaton in Vogue (see review above), where they are generally reproduced in larger size; this volume is perhaps more useful as commentary than for basking in Beaton's art. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Environmental Overkill: Whatever Happened to Common Sense?</h2><p>The author of Trashing the Planet and media commentator Guzzo offer a straightforward analysis that helps readers understand the scientific and political realities of environmental issues and make their own informed decisions about global warming, pollution, endangered species, and other environmental issues.</p><p><p><strong>Dixy Lee Ray </strong>(1914-1994) was a marine biologist.

This addiction can adversely affect blood sugar, urine pH, adrenal stability, digestive function, and tooth, gum and joint health, and can be a major contributor to spiraling vet bills. For six-plus decades, commercial grain-based cat food has been pushed upon the public for one main reason: corporate profit. Regrettably, it isn&#39;t just cats who are addicted; advertising has brainwashed humans into believing that feeding our obligate carnivore companions a meat-flavored, grain-based diet is the best way to show how much we care. The authors of this brief, straight-to-the-point cookbook wanted to break free and spend as many years as they could with their beloved housemates - quality time, not time spent watching them decline from commercial cat food.

Polisi was raised on a family legacy that led him into the life he loved as a member of the Colombos, one of the New York Mob&#x2019;s feared Five Families, and came of age when the Mafia was at the height of its vast wealth and power. <br><br>Known by his Mob name, Sally Ubatz (&#x201c;Crazy Sally&#x201d;), he ran an illegal after-hours gambling den, The Sinatra Club, that was a magic kingdom of crime and a hangout for up-and-coming mobsters like Gotti and the three wiseguys immortalized in Martin Scorsese&#x2019;s GoodFellas&#x2014;Henry Hill, Jimmy Burke, and Tommy DeSimone. For Polisi, the nonstop thrills of glory days spent robbing banks, hijacking trucks, pulling daring heists&#x2014;and getting away with it all, thanks to cops and public servants corrupted by Mob money&#x2014;were fleeting. When he was busted for drug trafficking, and already sickened by the bloodbath that engulfed the Mob as it teetered toward extinction, he flipped and became one of a breed he had loathed all his life&#x2014;a rat. <br><br>In this riveting, pulse-pounding, and, at times, darkly hilarious first-person chronicle of his brazen crimes, wild sexual escapades, and personal tragedies, Polisi tells his story of life inside the New York Mob in a voice straight from the streets. With shocking candor, he draws on a hard-won knowledge of Mob history to paint a neverbefore- seen picture of the inner workings of the Mob and the larger-than-life characters who populated a once extensive and secret underworld that, thanks to guys like him, no longer exists. <br><br>*** <br><br>I was always a street guy. I was into robbing and stealing and gambling and loan sharking. I wasn&#x2019;t involved in the bigmoney sit-downs, the labor racketeering and construction company shakedowns, the Garment District and garbage and cement company kickbacks. . . . For guys like me and Fox, my blood brother and crime partner, the thing we loved about being in that life was the action, the excitement. . . .We were in it for the money, sure. But it was the danger, the thrills that made the life of crime something special. <br><br>A guy like John Gotti was different. He was far more ambitious than me and Fox. He wasn&#x2019;t just in it for the rush and the riches. He wanted the power and the glory. <br><br>John Gotti&#x2019;s tragedy, if you can call it that, was that he was born too late for the old-school gangster crown that he craved. He began his rise as the Mob was beginning to crumble; by the time he got to the top, the bottom had dropped out. <br><br>From the beginning, John was charismatic and smart. He just wasn&#x2019;t cut out to be godfather. Once he became boss, he drove the bus right off the bridge. Or maybe it was the bus that drove him. Either way, I watched him go. <br><br>Here&#x2019;s how it all happened.</p><p><b>Sal Polisi</b> spent much of his life inside the New York Mafia before he flipped and provided testimony against key Family members.

A man of causes and contradictions, his contradictions are very much on dispay in these pages, as DiNunzio ( American Democracy and the Authoritarian Tradition in the West ) points out. Roosevelt expresses outrage over the wanton slaughter of game, yet he and his son Kermit kill more than 500 animals on an African safari. He supports equal rights for women but holds traditional views about their place in the home. Not a few of Roosevelt's opinions fall far short of political correctness by today's standards; TR scorns as "sentimental nonsense" the charge that white settlers stole the Indians' land and refers to the "backward race" and the "forward race" to distinguish between black and white Americans. Controversial, but consistently provoking and entertaining. Photos. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.TR continues to fascinate. More than most leaders, he embodied the contradictions of his age, and they are reflected in this most recent selection from his writings as rough rider, historian, president, and commentator. Capturing so multifaceted a personality through his words alone is difficult; doing so through a sampling of less than five percent of his writings is impossible. Here we are treated to brief excerpts that only hint at the complexity of the man. DiNunzio (history, Providence Coll.) rounds out his selection with a thumbnail biography of Roosevelt and brief introductions to topical sections dealing with TR and politics, patriotism, the outdoor life, women, race, and the arts. In many respects TR was well ahead of his time, but in others he reflected the prevailing sentiments of his era--something readers should keep in mind as they browse through this brief work.<br><i>- Nicholas C.

These intimate, irresistible letters, written over the course of their three-month separation, read like a passionate, epistolary novel full of longing, intrigue, and gossip.

In 1962, poet Ted Berrigan (The Sonnets) was an unknown New York writer. While visiting New Orleans, he eloped with 19-year-old Sandy Alper. Suspecting Ted of drug use, Sandy's parents became frightened and irrational and had her involuntarily committed to a mental ward, although after a few months, Sandy managed to flee with Ted. By 1969 the couple was divorced. This volume vividly preserves their young love through Ted's letters to Sandy while she was institutionalized--packed with rage, frustration, and thoughts about writing--and Sandy's responses, reporting on her reading and the little dramas of the mental ward. Seventeen years after Ted's death, this volume validate my presence in Ted's life, Sandy explains somewhat wistfully. According to Padgett, Ted's letters reveal much of the emotional turbulence that helped infuse The Sonnets with such energy and drive. It's time for less warm tears and more cold fury, writes Ted, transporting the reader to a time when a passionate and impulsive young woman could be committed for behavior contrary to social norms. Even those unfamiliar with Ted's poetry will be fascinated by the drama inherent in this collection. 20 b&amp;w illus. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What Hettie Jones did for the New York bohemian scene of the 1960s, Davis (The Dark Way to the Plaza, 1968) has done for the leftist 1930s. Her tale begins in 1933, when her daughter Claudia is born in New York City. Her husband, British journalist Claud Cockburn, has already returned to Europe to cover the struggle against German and Spanish fascism for his insider bulletin, The Week, soon to become an indispensable source of war news for the English-speaking left worldwide. For a time Davis, herself a published writer and magazine promotion manager, hopes for their reunion; while waiting, she and Claudia go to stay with her sister in Virginia. There she gradually builds a life working for the Department of Agriculture and is introduced to Washington's intellectually dynamic liberal-left world. She falls in love with economist Hermann Brunck, and they move in together. Then they join the American Communist Party, and Davis's account of that experience is masterful; she captures the intrigue of underground culture and the seductive, even irresistible, logic of Communist solutions, as well as Party operatives' frightening refusal to see contradictions or hear dissent. Brunck has a sudden breakdown, described by Davis in intimate, painfully stirring detail--from his paranoid delusions (which came to seem increasingly sane with the unfolding of the intricate webs of conspiracy spun by the Party, government Red-baiting, and world politics) to their moments of sexual passion in the mental hospital. Her conversations with both Freudian doctors and Party comrades reveal intelligent people participating in terrifyingly rigid thought systems, yet she reduces no one to caricature. Davis's memoir of her struggle to think for herself while buffeted by love and ideology is an agonizingly human account of one of history's most tormented decades. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Few reminiscences are as beautifully written and thoughtfully shaped as this one, and few are as interesting. Davis recounts the passion and the urgency of the Communist Party in the 1930s, with its certainty that the revolution would come and change the world, and the ultimate disillusionment when it failed to deliver its bright, populist promise. As much as she renders a portrait of the decade's politics, Davis also portrays a landscape of the writers, intellectuals, and idealists who populated pre-World War II Europe and America; such names as H. G. Wells, Christopher Isherwood, Ernest Hemingway, Nathanael West, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Evelyn Waugh crop up casually. More interesting, however, is how Davis weaves their stories with hers. Her descriptions of her loves, her child, and the events of her life are so exquisite and tuneful that her prose dances like the best poetry. Read her memoir for the writing, read it for the history, but read it--it's a treat. <i>Mary Ellen Sullivan</i></p><h2>The Giver</h2><p>It is a world without conflict, poverty and inequality.

Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of <i>Brave New World</i>, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society.

Emerging from the franchising process in the 1990s, Virgin Trains, although branded as a single entity, was in fact the product of two distinct franchises: the West Coast Main Line and InterCity Cross-Country. The two franchises were, to a considerable extent, amongst the most difficult on offer - the former as a result of its ageing infrastructure and rolling stock and the latter due to the convoluted route network over which it operated - and in its early years of operation Virgin Trains suffered significant adverse comment. However, as the WCML modernisation scheme was gradually completed and as the new high-speed Voyager and Pendelino units came into service, so the performance of the franchises improved as did the company&#39;s reputation. However, come franchise renewal, the Cross-Country franchise was modified and reallocated to Arriva, leaving Virgin Trains to continue operating the West Coast franchise. This album will mark the 15th anniversary of Virgin Trains and will be packed with colour illustrations portraying the evolution of Virgin Trains operations over the period from 1997 to 2012.</p><p>John Balmforth is a retired railwayman who is dedicated to carrying out work in the voluntary sector.

Hypothyroidism is frequently caused by an autoimmune thyroid condition known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Someone with hypothyroidism is sometimes said to have 'an under-active thyroid or 'low thyroid function'. The standard treatment for hypothyroidism at the present time is for a doctor to prescribe a medication called Levothyroxine (known as T4), which is usually taken once a day for the rest of the patient's life. There is growing awareness that some people do not appear to recover their former health using the standard T4 thyroid medication and may remain with many symptoms of hypothyroidism including: fatigue or feeling tired all the time, weakness, feeling cold, inability to lose weight, brain fog, digestive system problems and a range of other symptoms typical of an under-active thyroid gland. The author of 'Recovering With T3 My Journey from Hypothyroidism to Good Health Using the T3 Thyroid Hormone' discovered he was hypothyroid over twenty years ago. After many years of being treated with T4, he still had the majority of the symptoms that had first taken him to see his doctor. Eventually, after many years had passed, during which all known thyroid hormone treatments had been tried, a thyroid medication called liothyronine sodium was used. Liothyronine is a synthetic equivalent of the thyroid hormone T3. The use of T3 finally enabled the author to make a complete recovery, although there were many lessons that he needed to learn about T3 in order to regain his health. This book covers a vast amount of technical and practical information relating to T3 medication and details how the author applied this information in order to get well. Any reader who wishes to understand more about the T3 thyroid hormone will find this book invaluable. The book has a foreword by Dr. John C. Lowe, who has been a thyroid researcher and clinician for many years and is one of the world's foremost experts on T3 and its correct use. Dr. Lowe has this to say about the book: "Paul Robinson has written a book chock-full of information on T3 that is vitally important to many people. I believe that reading 'Recovering with T3' will be a splendid experience for thousands of people, whether clinicians, patients, patient advocates, or patients&#x2019; loved ones." Recovering with T3 is quite simply essential reading for any patient and their doctor if they are considering the use of the T3 thyroid hormone</p><p></p><h2>Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes</h2><p>Roland Barthes was one of France&#39;s leading literary critics and cultural commentators who died in 1980. This work, first published in 1977 has come to be seen as one of the author&#39;s key works. It is a kind of autobiography, both personal and theoretical, giving an account of his tastes, his childhood, his body then and later in life, his education, his passions and regrets.

Large print edition.</p><p><p>Billy Graham, world-renowned author, preacher, and evangelist, has delivered the Gospel message to more people face-to-face than anyone in history and has ministered on every continent of the world in more than 185 countries. Millions have read his inspirational classics, including&nbsp;<em>Angels</em>,<em>&nbsp;Peace with God</em>,<em>&nbsp;The Holy Spirit</em>,<em>&nbsp;Hope for the Troubled Heart</em>,<em>&nbsp;How to Be Born Again</em>,<em>&nbsp;The Journey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Nearing Home,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Reason For My Hope.</em></p></p><h2>In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu&#39;s Congo</h2><p>He was known as "the Leopard," and for the thirty-two years of his reign Mobutu Sese Seko, president of Zaire, showed all the cunning of his namesake, seducing Western powers, buying up the opposition, and dominating his people with a devastating combination of brutality and charm. While the population was pauperized, he plundered the country's copper and diamond resources, downing pink champagne in his jungle palace like some modern-day reincarnation of Joseph Conrad's crazed station manager.<p>Michela Wrong, a correspondent who witnessed firsthand Mobutu's last days, traces the rise and fall of the idealistic young journalist who became the stereotype of an African despot. Engrossing, highly readable, and as funny as it is tragic, her book assesses how Belgium's King&nbsp;Leopold, the CIA, and the World Bank all helped to bring about the disaster that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. If, in this poignant account, the villains are the "Big Vegetables"&nbsp; (<em>les Grosses lï¿½gumes</em>) -- the fat cats who benefited from Mobutu's largesse -- the heroes are the ordinary citizens trapped in a parody of a state. Living in the shadow of a disintegrating nuclear reactor, where banknotes are not worth the paper they are printed on, they have turned survival into an art form. For all its valuable insights into Africa's colonial heritage and the damage done by Western intervention, <em>In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz</em> is ultimately a celebration of the irrepressible human spirit.</p></p><p>During Mobutu Sese Seko's 30 years as president of Zaire (now the Congo), he managed to plunder his nation's economy and live a life of excess unparalleled in modern history. A foreign correspondent in Zaire for six years, Michela Wrong has plenty of titillating stories to tell about Mobutu's excesses, such as the Versailles-like palace he built in the jungle, or his insistence that he needed $10 million a month to live on. However, these are not the stories that most interest Wrong. Her aim is to understand <i>all</i> of the reasons behind the economic disintegration of the most mineral-rich country on the African continent; in so doing, she turns over the mammoth rock that was Mobutu and finds a seething underworld of parasites with names like the CIA, the World Bank and the IMF, the French and Belgian governments, mercenaries, and a host of fat cats who benefited from Mobutu's largesse and even exceeded his rapaciousness. <p> Wrong turns first to Belgian's King Leopold II, who instituted a brutal colonial regime in the Congo in order to extract the natural and mineral wealth for his personal gain. Mobutu, with the aid of a U.S. government determined to sabotage Soviet expansion, stepped easily into Leopold's footsteps, continuing a culture built on government-sanctioned sleaze and theft. Under the circumstances, it's hard not to feel some sympathy for the people who survived in the only ways they could--teachers trading passing grades for groceries, hospitals refusing to let patients leave until they paid up, cassava patches cultivated next to the frighteningly unsafe nuclear reactor.

The chowder is a style unique to southern New England shores: steel-gray, briny, full of clam flavor, plenty of clam meat, and a handful of potatoes; and the lobsters are steamed to perfection. But beyond these glories, Abbott&#x2019;s posted menu suggests a whole range of other fine seafood items: steamers, mussels, clams and/or oysters on the half shell, hot lobster rolls that are nothing but buttered pink meat on a bun, lobster salad rolls (cool, bound with mayonnaise), crab rolls (hot or cold), and shrimp salad rolls. There is even broiled chicken for the lost soul who finds himself at this great seafood restaurant craving poultry. <br><br>Abbott&#x2019;s is a very pretty place to dine al fresco. Seating is at bare wooden tables (although civilized sorts bring their own tablecloths as well as their own wine); the air is filled with the salt smell of shore breezes, and background music is provided by gulls screeching in the sky (but kept away from the tables by invisible netting).<br><br><b>Big Dipper Ice Cream Factory<br>91 Waterbury Rd.<br>Prospect, CT<br>203&#x2014;758&#x2014;3200<br>$<br><br></b>Here is irrefutable evidence that ice cream makes you happy. The girls behind the counter, no matter how fast they scoop on a busy summer night when the line for cones and cups goes clear out the door, are delighted to be Big Dipper folk. Many of them are high school girls, some are older women who started here in high school but enjoy coming back during vacations because they consider themselves part of the Big Dipper family. You will understand their bliss when first you taste the amazing toasted almond ice cream, which the boss says was originally inspired by a vintage Good Humor bar, but which we say transcends it. <br><br>If this particular flavor is not your idea of heaven on earth, don&#x2019;t worry. The Big Dipper has a few dozen others, ranging from silly (cotton candy) to swank (cafï¿½ Vienna, which is coffee and cinnamon) to serious (espresso). All are rich in butterfat (16 percent), but not so rich that they cloy. These are ice creams we can easily eat double and triple dips of, several times a week. The repertoire changes daily, but you always can count on toasted almond.<br><br><b>Blackie&#x2019;s<br>2200 Waterbury Rd.<br>Cheshire, CT<br>203&#x2014;699&#x2014;1819<br>LD (closed Fridays) | $<br></b><br>Blackie&#x2019;s just may serve the best hot dog in Connecticut, a state with some of the highest hot dog consciousness in the nation. While there are a couple of other items on the menu (hamburgers, cheeseburgers), hot dogs are so entirely the specialty of the house that most regular customers sit down at the counter and simply call out a number, indicating how many they want. <br><br>The dogs are pink Hummel-brand plumpies that are boiled in oil to the point that they literally blossom with flavor as their outside surface bursts apart. They are served plain in basic buns, and it is up to each customer to spoon out mustard and relish from condiment trays that are set out all along the counter. That&#x2019;s the really good part about dining at Blackie&#x2019;s: dressing the dogs. The mustard is excellent, and we recommend a modest bed of it applied to the top of each wiener, all the better for the relish to cling to. The relish is transcendent: thick, luxurious, dark green, and pepper-hot enough that your lips will glow after lunch. Blackie&#x2019;s&#x2013;and its customers&#x2013;are so devoted to this formula for frankfurter perfection that the kitchen doesn&#x2019;t even bother to offer sauerkraut or chili. <br><br>Blackie&#x2019;s is a charming destination dog house, especially in good weather when the long counter offers semi&#x2014;al fresco seating. Service is nearly instantaneous, so if your preference is <i>hot</i> hot dogs, it is entirely practical to order them one by one until you can&#x2019;t eat any more.<br><br><b>La Borinqueï¿½a<br>992 Bank St.<br>New London, CT<br>860&#x2014;437&#x2014;0408<br>LD | $<br></b><br>&#x201c;La Borinqueï¿½a&#x201d; is the title of the anthem of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but a lot of regular customers know this cute little eat-shop by the name on the sign outside: Roast Pork Cafï¿½. <br><br>It&#x2019;s an apt name when you consider the magnificent pork sandwich that is the signature dish. It is made of pork shoulder, roasted all night until the skin is as crisp as bacon and the inside is velvet soft. The meat is cut with a scissors into variegated shreds, chunks, and strips that are piled inside a long hero roll, preferably with a layer of Swiss cheese and some mayonnaise, then toasted in a sandwich press that converts the potentially fall-apart sandwich into a tidy tube. The pork packs an amazing flavor punch; it is salty, redolent of spice, and dripping juice. While it is possible to have a &#x201c;Cuban&#x201d; sandwich, to which ham is added, and even a <i>tripletas</i> (pork, ham, and steak), we love the simplicity and intensity of pork, cheese, and bread. <br><br>In addition to magnificent sandwiches, the Colï¿½n family offers fried chicken, roasted chicken, and such fascinating side dishes as yucca patties, green banana patties, and meat-stuffed potato balls. There is a lunch special every day, including fried pork chops and breaded steak on Monday, with a choice of white or yellow rice on the side. <br><br>The restaurant&#x2019;s interior isn&#x2019;t much more than a tiny kitchen and order counter. Seating is outdoors at picnic tables, and all meals are available to go.<br><br><b>Carminuccio&#x2019;s<br>76 South Main St. (Route 25)<br>Newtown, CT<br>203&#x2014;364&#x2014;1133<br>LD | $<br><br></b>One of the lesser-known culinary gold mines in Connecticut is Route 25 between Monroe and Newtown. A garish, congested patch of two-lane with more than its fair share of <i>un</i>interesting places of business, it happens to be home of at least two superb hot dogs (at the Botsford DriveIn and Mr. Mac&#x2019;s Canteen), nice Italian sandwiches (at Panino&#x2019;s), plus a number of promising diners and cafï¿½s we have yet to try. One of the reasons we haven&#x2019;t done a whole lot of homework on this stretch of road is that we are so often drawn to Carminuccio&#x2019;s. Here in Connecticut, home of America&#x2019;s most delicious pizzas, this house by the side of the highway serves some of the best.<br><br>When you walk in, it isn&#x2019;t much to look at. The interior consists of an order counter and a small array of bare-topped tables with a glass case in back holding cannoli, stuffed breads, and a few pasta dishes. If you look to the right as you enter, you will see a most appealing sight: pizzas being made to order. Available toppings range from basic cheese to escarole and beans, barbecued chicken, sautï¿½ed spinach, and a knockout BLT combo of pesto sauce, bacon, sautï¿½ed escarole, and roasted tomatoes. Pepperoni and sausage are generously applied; we especially recommend roasted peppers. These meaty little squiggles are radiant with flavor, and just wonderful on a pizza with nothing other than cheese. As for the crust, it&#x2019;s Neapolitan style, meaning it is fairly thin with a chewy rim of crust all around the circumference and a brittle undercrust with enough grit from the oven to give it real character. <br><br>Beyond the pizza, do pay attention to the stuffed breads. These are fat savory loaves wrapped around such ingredients as ham or capicola, pepperoni and cheese, broccoli and sausage. Served steaming hot, one of these breads is a soulful meal every bit as satisfying as a pizza.<br><br><b>David&#x2019;s<br>1647 Route 85<br>Chesterfield, CT<br>860&#x2014;442&#x2014;7120<br>LD (summer only) | $</b><br><br>One of our favorite sunny summer day drives is along Route 85 just west of the Thames. There, in Chesterfield, we pay a visit to our favorite rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; fossil store&#x2013;Nature&#x2019;s Art&#x2013;and go across the road for thick card board plates piled high with excellent whole-bellied fried clams (strips are also available).<br><br>The menu at this cheerful drive-in is eat-in-the-rough fare with a Greek twist. The twist can be tasted in the form of spinach pie&#x2013;a plate of savory, well-spiced spinach-and-feta-and-phyllo served with French fries and cole slaw&#x2013;but the list of non-Greek items are such Yankee shore standbys as shrimp, scallops, and calamari&#x2013;each fried to golden goodness, as well as top-drawer fish &#x2019;n&#x2019; chips. <br><br>While the fried food is exemplary, the sleepers on David&#x2019;s menu are grinders. These are some mighty hero sandwiches; their fillings ranging from demure tuna salad to a spectacular <i>steak bomb</i>, which means the sliced beef is topped with sautï¿½ed onions, peppers, mushrooms, and cheese. And, this being a Greek-run kitchen, we recommend paying close attention to the gyro and chicken gyro grinders. They&#x2019;re immensely satisfying versions of the street-food sandwich, particularly good with a pile of David&#x2019;s fresh-cut French fries. For dessert: homemade rice pudding.<br><br><b>Chez Lï¿½nard<br>Main St.<br>Ridgefield, CT<br>No phone<br>LD | $<br></b><br>Chez Lï¿½nard of Ridgefield has no address and no phone number. It is a sidewalk cart on Main Street with no tables or chairs. Accommodations for dining include sidewalk standing room and Ballard Park across the street. Some car customers pull to the curb, toot their horn, and get their meal delivered to the window without ever leaving the driver&#x2019;s seat. <br><br>Despite the lack of amenities, Chez Lï¿½nard is indubitably high tone. When the original &#x201c;Lï¿½nard,&#x201d; a Manhattan rat-race refugee, parked his cart here in 1978, he established an urbane ambience with a French accent that has thrived under subsequent proprietors&#x2019; incumbency. Citizens of Ridgefield have come to treasure the happy incongruity of a man in a billowy chef&#x2019;s toque exclaiming &#x201c;oo-la-la!&#x201d; as he slathers on hot relish, or &#x201c;<i>merci beaucoup</i>&#x201d; when making change. The blackboard menu lists such exotic-sounding delights as &#x201c;Le Hot Dog Choucroute Alsacienne&#x201d; (with sauerkraut and mustard), &#x201c;Le Hot Dog Excelsior Veneziano&#x201d; (with Italian peppers and sautï¿½ed onions), and &#x201c;Le Hot Dog Faï¿½on Mexicaine&#x201d; (a chili dog). <br><br>The dogs themselves, plucked with tongs from a hot water bath in the cart, are <i>magnifiques</i>: kosher all-beef franks with a taut casing and firm insides, long enough to stick out from both ends of the bun, and buxom enough that a pair of &#x201c;Supremes&#x201d; (with mustard, relish, ketchup, and chopped onions) with a can of Dr. Brown&#x2019;s soda make an immensely satisfying meal.<br><br>Chez Lï¿½nard is open year-round, every day except Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas or when the weather is extremely awful. &#x201c;I am pitied in the winter,&#x201d; says proprietor Chad Cohen. &#x201c;But I am envied in the summer.

Closer to thirty inches. While one of them, in its yard-long bun, looks like a party sandwich for a table of eaters, especially if it is loaded with sauerkraut, chili, onions, bacon, cheese, etc., you will see some big boys walking into Doogie&#x2019;s at lunchtime and ingesting a pair of them (that&#x2019;s about six feet of frankfurter!) with a large soda and an order of jumbo French fries with cheese sauce on the side.<br><br> If only for its size, Doogie&#x2019;s hot dog would be worth noting in the annals of amazing Roadfood; but the more important fact is that this extra-long sausage is delicious. Firm-fleshed and with a chewy skin that gets slightly charred on the grill, it has a vigorously spicy flavor that holds up well not only under any and all extra-cost toppings but also when spread with Doogie&#x2019;s superb homemade hot relish or just ordinary mustard. The brand name of the dog is Grote &amp; Weigal, and for those of meek appetites, it is available in mere ten-inch configuration, too. Mention must also be made of the bun, which of necessity is significantly sturdier than your ordinary cotton-soft hot dog roll. More like a grinder roll, but somewhat slimmer, Doogie&#x2019;s bun is actual, good-quality bread! We have never seen anyone actually pick up a whole hot dog and bun, though. Etiquette for eating one of these fellas is to grasp one end eight to ten inches from the tip and tear off a section that would be about the size of a normal frankfurter anywhere else. You&#x2019;ll get about four of these per dog. <br><br>Beyond hot dogs, Doogie&#x2019;s sells all sorts of other sandwiches, New England&#x2014;style clam chowder, a real hot lobster roll, and that junkiest of junk foods, so beloved hereabouts&#x2013;fried dough. Doogie&#x2019;s version, a plate-size disc of deep-fried dough, is available veiled in cinnamon sugar or under a blanket of red tomato sauce. Either way, it is a mouthful! <br><br>Hamburgers, cooked on the same charcoal grill where the hot dogs are made, have a delicious smoky flavor. The top-of-the-line hamburger is described on the menu as &#x201c;the ultimate&#x201d;; and while not as awesome as the elongated hot dog, it is quite a sight: two five-ounce patties with bacon, cheese, grilled onions, and sautï¿½ed mushrooms. Its formal name on the menu is the Murder Burger. <br><br>Casual in the extreme, Doogie&#x2019;s is a serve-yourself joint (adjacent to Ruth&#x2019;s Chris Steak House, which might be a good fallback if you arrive after 8 P.M. when Doogie&#x2019;s closes). Step up to the counter, place your order, pay your money, and wait for your name to be called. When your order is ready, tote your tray to the condiment bar, heap on what you like, find a molded plastic seat in the square little dining room, and prepare to feast on the king of all weenies.</p><h2>A SURPRISE IN THE MAILBOX (Bear in the Big Blue House)</h2><p>Tutter flies into a frenzy cleaning the house for his Grandmother&#39;s visit until he realizes that she will love him no matter what</p><p></p><h2>Journey Into Healing: Awakening the Wisdom Within You</h2><p>Offers inspirational essays on the healing process, the mind-body connection, and the use of mindful meditation to promote health</p><p>1 cassette / 1 hour<br>Read by Deepak Chopra<br>Also available on Compact Disc<br><br>From the bestselling author of <i>Ageless Body, Timeless Mind</i>.<br><br>Essential ideas from the work of Deepak Chopra, M.D. are arranged to create a transcendent experience for the listener, a journey into healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the path, we discover that what we think and feel can actually change our biology.&nbsp;&nbsp;We learn to go beyond self-imposed limitations that create disease, and to seek that place inside ourselves that is at one with the infinite intelligence of the universe, the source of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of this audio, the listener's consciousness will have been altered by the experience of the journey itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such change has the power to transform out lives, to grace us with the gifts of lasting peace and perfect health.<br><br>The end of the audio contains techniques for the Mindfulness Mediation, which can access the silent space between your thoughts, and tap into the inner wisdom that will make all you dream s comes true.In this book I have sought to select essential thoughts from my various books and arrange them so as to give the reader the experience of a journey into healing.

At the site known as Kerma, near the third cataract of the Nile, archaeologist Charles Bonnet and his team discovered a ditch within a temple from the ancient city of Pnoubs, which contained seven monumental black granite statues. Magnificently sculpted, and in an excellent state of preservation, they portrayed five pharaonic rulers, including Taharqa and Tanoutamon, the last two pharaohs of the 'Nubian' Dynasty, when Egypt was ruled by kings from the lands of modern-day Sudan. For over half a century, the Nubian pharaohs governed a combined kingdom of Egypt and Nubia, with an empire stretching from the Delta to the upper reaches of the Nile.<br><br>The seven statues, with their exquisite workmanship, transform our understanding of the art of this period. In particular, the colossal statue of Taharqa--almost certainly done by an Egyptian sculptor--is a masterpiece of stone artwork. Beautifully illustrated with over 170 color photographs, The Nubian Pharaohs illuminates the epic history of this little-known historical era, when the pharaohs of Egypt came from Sudan.

In <i>Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution</i>, Caroline Cox reconstructs the lives and stories of this young subset of early American soldiers, focusing on how these boys came to join the army and what they actually did in service. Giving us a rich and unique glimpse into colonial childhood, Cox traces the evolution of youth in American culture in the late eighteenth century, as the accepted age for children to participate meaningfully in society--not only in the military--was rising dramatically.<br><br>Drawing creatively on sources, such as diaries, letters, and memoirs, Caroline Cox offers a vivid account of what life was like for these boys both on and off the battlefield, telling the story of a generation of soldiers caught between old and new notions of boyhood.<br><br></p><p>Caroline Cox (1954-2014) was professor of history at the University of the Pacific and author of<i> <i></i>A Proper Sense of Honor: Service and Sacrifice in George Washington's Army</i>.Expertly detail[s] the social fabric of the founding era. . . .

Until the day she meets Pearl, the eldest daughter of a zealous American missionary.<br>Pearl is head-strong, independent and fiercely intelligent, and will grow up to be Pearl S Buck, the Pulitzer- and Nobel Prize-winning writer and humanitarian activist, but for now all Willow knows is that she has never met anyone like her in all her life. From the start the two are thick as thieves, but when the Boxer Rebellion rocks the nation, Pearl's family is forced to leave China to flee religious persecution. As the twentieth century unfolds in all its turmoil, through right-wing military coups and Mao's Red Revolution, through bad marriages and broken dreams, the two girls cling to their lifelong friendship across the sea.</p><p>In this ambitious and moving new novel, Anchee Min, acclaimed author of <i>Empress Orchid </i>and <i>Red Azalea</i>, brings to life a courageous and passionate woman who loved the country of her childhood and who has been hailed in China as a modern heroine.</p></p><p><b>Anchee Min</b> was born in Shanghai in 1957. At seventeen she was sent to a labor collective, where a talent scout for Madame Mao's Shanghai Film Studio recruited her to work as a movie actress. She moved to the United States in 1984. Her memoir, <i>Red Azalea</i>, was an international bestseller, published in twenty countries.<p>&#x201c;In [Min's] latest book, <i>Pearl of China</i>, she creates a fanciful yet believable world for the Nobel laureate Pearl Buck through the voice of an imagined Chinese woman, Willow Yee, whose unwavering friendship with Buck has endured the test of turbulent times in Chinese history... Min skillfully blends real historical figures ...with fictional characters to authenticate the story's social and political context...

The two women form a spiritual and emotional bond that resists political turmoil, the violence of civil war, romantic rivalry and eventually, the distance imposed by communism... Min echoes Buck's talent for showing compassion and empathy toward her characters, and like her, reveals the power and dignity contained in the lives of ordinary people.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Associated Press</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Pearl of China</i> is a loving tribute to Buck and a unique peek into the hearts and lives of the Chinese people who knew her. As with all of her books, Min - like Buck before her - exposes the cruel, isolating existence that China's rulers inflicted on much of the country's population during the different decades that the two women lived there. And both women showed the inspiring, courageous ways in which even the most besieged of the lowest classes maintained their wit and humanity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Oregonian</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this ambitious and moving novel, the acclaimed author of <i>Empress Orchid</i> and <i>Red Azalea </i>brings to life the woman who loved the country of her childhood and who has been hailed in China as a modern heroine.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A gifted and lyrical writer.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;In this excellent interpretation of Pearl's story from a Chinese perspective told with a haunting quality only Anchee Min can deliver, the bestselling author of <i>Red Azalea </i>and <i>Empress Orchid </i>again focuses her attention on influential women of her native China...this rewarding read passes far too quickly.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bookreporter.com</i></p></p><h2>Martingale That Patchwork Place English Paper Piecing II</h2><p><p>In this follow-up to her best-selling book <i>English Paper Piecing,</i> Vicki Bellino presents a collection of enticing new designs for quilters of all ages and skill levels.</p><ul><li>Expand your repertoire with a variety of shapes and add English paper piecing to quilts, table runners, and more</li><li>Choose from 11 eye-catching items ranging from a tote and sewing-machine cover to wall and lap quilts</li><li>Create relatively simple projects as well as more challenging designs</li></ul></p><p><p>Vicki learned to quilt in 1986 and hasn't stopped since!

He published his first novel, It Walks by Night, in 1930 while studying in Paris to become a barrister. Shortly thereafter he settled in his wife's native England where he wrote prolifically, averaging four novels per year until the end of WWII. Well-known as a master of the locked-room mystery, Carr created eccentric sleuths to solve apparently impossible crimes. His two most popular series detectives were Dr. Fell, who debuted in Hag's Nook in 1933, and barrister Sir Henry Merrivale (published under the pseudonym of Carter Dickson), who first appeared in The Plague Court Murders (1934). Eventually, Carr left England and moved to South Carolina where he continued to write, publishing several more novels and contributing a regular column to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. In his lifetime, Carr received the Mystery Writers of America's highest honor, the Grand Master Award, and was one of only two Americans ever admitted into the prestigious - but almost exclusively British - Detection Club. He died in 1977.&nbsp;</p><h2>King Arthur &amp; His Knights (Children's Classics)</h2><p>Recounts the tales of King Arthur and his knights, from the early prophecies of Merlin and Arthur&#39;s birth to the destruction of Camelot.</p><p>Sir James Knowle&#39;s epic tale of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Tale is resurrected in this ornate children&#39;s edition.

Due to China&#39;s size and history of successive wealthy dynasties, a vast amount of textile art is available for study today. Great tombs have yielded beautiful and dateable pieces worn and used by elite members of Chinese society. These and other fragile examples reside in museums and a few private collections. Other examples of antique Chinese textiles are found still to be in the marketplace. While it is impossible to look at these beautiful examples and not admire the skill of the weaver and embroiderer, until now there has been little information about their history or value. This comprehensive guide to collectible Chinese textiles with an extensive number of examples and with an understandable grading system that relates to what constitutes value. This book is beautifully illustrated with over 500 detailed photos of ceremonial court robes, badges, and decorative textiles dating from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) through the Ching dynasty, (1644-1911). It is designed for historians, Asian studies sholars, and textile collectors, from beginning to advanced, as a real-world representation of available pieces and an indepth study. It is a must for appraisers and connoisseurs alike.</p><p>Based in Michigan, Paul Haig travels throughout the world to collect and explore his interest in Asian art.

Conservative men may perceive this as a threat to the traditional privilege of taking their members out of their pants and relieving themselves wherever they choose. But progressive contemporaries are already dreaming about unisex pissoirs. Hardcover w/jacket, color.

Yet just below the surface, a sense of dread, alienation, and the haunting specter of radical evil permeated American art and literature. Writers returned home from World War II and gave form to their disorienting experiences of violence and cruelty. They probed the darkness that the war opened up and confronted bigotry, existential guilt, ecological concerns, and fear about the nature and survival of the human race. In <i>Facing the Abyss</i>, George Hutchinson offers readings of individual works and the larger intellectual and cultural scene to reveal the 1940s as a period of profound and influential accomplishment.<br><br><i>Facing the Abyss </i>examines the relation of aesthetics to politics, the idea of universalism, and the connections among authors across racial, ethnic, and gender divisions. Modernist and avant-garde styles were absorbed into popular culture as writers and artists turned away from social realism to emphasize the process of artistic creation. Hutchinson explores a range of important writers, from Saul Bellow and Mary McCarthy to Richard Wright and James Baldwin. African American and Jewish novelists critiqued racism and anti-Semitism, women writers pushed back on the misogyny unleashed during the war, and authors such as Gore Vidal and Tennessee Williams reflected a new openness in the depiction of homosexuality. The decade also witnessed an awakening of American environmental and ecological consciousness. Hutchinson argues that despite the individualized experiences depicted in these works, a common belief in art&#x2019;s ability to communicate the universal in particulars united the most important works of literature and art during the 1940s. Hutchinson&#x2019;s capacious view of American literary and cultural history masterfully weaves together a wide range of creative and intellectual expression into a sweeping new narrative of this pivotal decade.</p><p>George Hutchinson is the Newton C. Farr Professor of American Culture in the Department of English at Cornell University, where he also directs the John S. Knight Institute. His books include<i> The Harlem Renaissance in Black and White </i>(1996) and<i> In Search of Nella Larsen: A Biography of the Color Line </i>(2006).Bringing together art, literature, philosophy, and music, Hutchinson has created a kind of critical mosaic that produces insights that open up the 1940s as a cultural field, grounded in the ungrounded processes of art as incalculable experience. The juxtapositions of unconnected figures induce in the reader a new vision of the era and new dimensions of the authors and works discussed. It is a work of exceptionally deft intellectual choreography, conducted with enviable precision and concision. (Ross Posnock, Columbia University)<br><br>In <i>Facing the Abyss</i>, George<i> </i>Hutchinson brilliantly reorders our understanding of an era long overshadowed by the spectacular events of World War II. This is an important and exciting book&#x2015;original, revisionary, visionary&#x2015;that deserves our full attention and praise. (Arnold Rampersad, Stanford University)<br><br><i>Facing the Abyss: American Literature and Culture in the 1940s </i>is a brilliantly conceived project destined to become a landmark book. With just the right amount of polemical energy, Hutchinson mobilizes his facts with verve and precision in this indispensable work that transforms our sense of this turbulent decade. (Maria DiBattista, Princeton University)<br><br>A richly detailed investigation of burgeoning creativity in a decade marked by both hope and dread. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>A cross-genre study that illuminates common ideational content drifting across American culture in that tumultuous decade. . . . Hutchinson's study bodes fair to become a classic in the field of American literary studies. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><i>Facing the Abyss</i> shines a light on a neglected decade, turning it into an overture to the rest of the century, and it contributes a rich historical viewpoint to our own conflicting concerns about identity. (Morris Dickstein <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>A dazzling work of cultural history. . . . <i>Facing the Abyss</i> is a book to ponder, argue with, and admire for the author&#x2019;s ability to cut across genres and art forms without leaving readers stranded in a dead end. (Bernard F. Dick <i>The Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>George Hutchinson&#x2019;s <i>Facing the Abyss</i> has bracing and revelatory things to say about American culture in the 1940s; also, by contrast and implication, about American culture today. . . . The culture and literature of the 1940s were, Hutchinson found when writing about them, 'both unexpected and inspiring.' As is this book. (Edward Mendelson <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>This grand beyond: The travels of Isabella Bird Bishop</h2><p>Isabella Bird Bishop was born in 1831. At the age of forty she rejected the conventional, pious and benevolent life of a cleric&#39;s daughter and Victorian gentlewoman in favor of the romance of travel, hardship and danger in some of the remotest regions of the world. No place was too distant or too hazardous; on foot, horseback, yak and elephant she visited the frontiersmen of the American West, the Rocky Mountains, the Sandwich Islands, the &#39;hairy Ainu&#39; of northern Japan, the forbidden cities of Tibet, Persia and Kurdistan, Korea, the Malay Peninsula; she made a perilous journey up the Yangtze River and set out on a last romantic ride in the Atlas Mountains. The Far East had a special attraction and many of the places she saw had only recently been opened to foreigners. Isabella Bird Bishop&#39;s ability to relate to peoples of all races and cultures was combined with formidable powers of endurance: neither floods nor tigers, corrupt officials or local hostility, extremes of climate, jungle or mountain terrain ever stood in her way. She married Dr John Bishop at fifty but when he died after five happy but travel-free years, she paused only to take a brief nursing course before setting off for Tibet. She published nine books about her travels, all of them bestsellers in their time, and all represented in this anthology. The profits from her writings were plowed into a variety of charitable causes in England and Scotland. Her life and writings, she declared, &#39;vindicated the right of a woman to do anything which she can do well&#39;. This Grand Beyond shows Isabella at her best. A geographer of repute with excellent descriptive abilities, her writing is at once exact and dramatic, humorous and eloquent, and guaranteed to create an appetite for adventure and faraway places.</p><p></p><h2>The Matarese Circle</h2><p>Great example of Ludlum&#39;s skill</p><p>Only two rival spies--and one mysterious woman--can stop them: Scofield, CIA, and Talaniekov, KGB.

The Core Classics are generally considered suitable for fourth and fifth grade students. The texts are illustrated, annotated, and include a brief biography of the author. From the Introduction The story of Robinson Crusoe was inspired by a real-life castaway. In 1705, Alexander Selkirk, a Scotsman, argued angrily with the captain of his ship over whether their boat was too leaky to sail. After the boat stopped to get fresh water at an island in the Pacific Ocean, Selkirk refused to go back on board. So the captain left him there alone with a Bible, a gun, a kettle, and a few tools and supplies. Four-and-a-half years later another English ship visiting the island saw a signal fire and found Selkirk still alive. Today, the island is named for him.</p><p></p><h2>Francios Villon Complete Poems</h2><p><p>Franï¿½ois Villon was the last of the great medieval poets, as important in his own, more limited, sphere as Chaucer or Dante. His fame surpasses that of any other medieval French lyricist in spite of the modest quantity, uneven quality, and often repellent subject-matter of his work. His poems are largely autobiographical, and are rich in their descriptions of thefts, fights, nocturnal prowling, imprisonment, and exile. However, as Barbara Sargent-Baur points out, when Villon's work is good, it is very good, indeed unforgettable. His two major works are the Lais, a series of bequests in anticipation of his prudent departure from Paris, and Testament, which is about his primary topic, himself.</p><p>This is the first edition of the whole of the corpus of Villon translations that utilizes a re-reading of all the manuscript sources and presenting for each poem a single-source text with all emendations accounted for. It is also the first annotated English version based on the best-text principle and respecting both Villon's meaning and his metrics. A modern edition of the French texts is presented beside the English on facing pages. In an extensive commentary, Sargent-Baur identifies the poet's literary and historical allusions, as well as place-names, legatees, and biographical data.</p></p><p><p>'An accurate edition and readable facing-page translation of Villon's poems that we can recommend in good conscience to our students.'</p>Text: English, French (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Theodosia and the Staff of Osiris</h2><p>Theodosia Throckmorton is in a fix.

Blocked at every turn, Theodosia will have to rely on her own skill and cunning&#x2014;along with a little help from the most unexpected places.</p><p>R. L. LaFevers (Robin Lorraine when she&#x2019;s in really big trouble) has been fascinated by libraries and museums ever since she first set foot in one. When she&#x2019;s not gazing longingly at ancient artifacts or wallowing in old forgotten texts, she&#x2019;s busy trying to keep one step ahead of her two teenage sons. She lives with the aforementioned sons, her husband, and a demonic cat in Southern California.Chapter One: A Grand Fete<br><br> The lace on my party frock itched horribly. I don&#x2019;t understand how they can make things as complex as motorcars or machines that fly but can&#x2019;t invent itchless lace. Although Mother didn&#x2019;t seem to be plagued with this problem, I would have to pay close attention to the other ladies at the reception this evening to see if they exhibit any symptoms.<br> You&#x2019;re surprisingly quiet, Theodosia,&#x201d; Father said, interrupting my thoughts.<br> Surprisingly&#x201d;? Whatever did he mean by that, I wonder? I would have thought you&#x2019;d be chattering a mile a minute about Lord Chudleigh&#x2019;s reception.&#x201d; Tonight was to be my big introduction to professional life. And I planned to savor every second of it. I would be the first eleven-year-old girl ever to walk in their midst. What if they should ask me to make a speech? Wouldn&#x2019;t that be grand? I would stand there, with all eyes on me keepers and lords and sirs and all sorts of fancy folk and then I would . . . have to say something. Maybe having to speak wouldn&#x2019;t be such a great idea after all. Mother put her gloved hand on Father&#x2019;s arm. She&#x2019;s most likely nervous, Alistair. The only young girl among so many important dignitaries and officials? I would have been tongue-tied at her age.&#x201d; Well. That wasn&#x2019;t very comforting. Maybe I should have been more nervous than I was. The carriage turned a corner and my stomach dipped uneasily.<br>We reached Lord Chudleigh&#x2019;s residence in Mayfair, a large red brick mansion with white columns and windowpanes. At the door, a butler bowed and greeted Father by name. Then we were motioned inside, where we joined an absolutely mad throng of people, all dressed in fine frocks and evening coats. There were marble floors, and the hallway sported Greek columns. Actually, the whole place had the touch of a museum about it: Grecian urns, a bust of Julius Caesar, and even a full coat of armor standing at attention. Suddenly I was glad of all that itchy lace otherwise I would have felt dreadfully underdressed. I slipped my hand into Mother&#x2019;s. Lord Chudleigh&#x2019;s house is even grander than Grandmother Throckmorton&#x2019;s,&#x201d; I whispered. Don&#x2019;t let her hear you say that,&#x201d; Father said.<br> How could she possibly hear me?&#x201d; I scoffed. She&#x2019;s miles away in her own grand house.&#x201d; The look on Father&#x2019;s face gave me pause. Isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; I asked hesitantly.<br> I&#x2019;m afraid not.&#x201d; His tone was clipped, as if he wasn&#x2019;t very happy about it, either. She moves in the same social circles as Lord Chudleigh.&#x201d; That was the sort of news that could ruin an entire evening. One might think that was a bit of an overstatement, if one didn&#x2019;t know my grandmother. I stared out at the crowd of people, desperate to spot Grandmother. If I saw her first, it would make avoiding her all that much easier.<br>Although really, I oughtn&#x2019;t worry, I told myself as we moved into the enormous ballroom. I was on my best behavior and had no intention of drawing any unpleasant attention to myself. Not even Grandmother would be able to find fault with me tonight. Except she believes children in general, and me in particular, should be seen as little as possible and heard even less. Just my being here would be an enormous affront to her sense of propriety.<br>Music played in the background, but people weren&#x2019;t dancing they just stood about talking and drinking champagne. We weaved our way among the guests until a tall man who looked vaguely familiar waved us over. Father immediately altered his course and began herding Mother and me in that direction.<br> When we reached the gentleman, he leaned forward and thumped Father on the back. It&#x2019;s about time you showed up, Throckmorton. At least you had the good sense to bring your lovely wife.&#x201d; Mum put her hand out, but instead of shaking it, the man lifted it to his lips and kissed it! He&#x2019;d better not try that with me, was all I could think. Luckily, he didn&#x2019;t. In fact, he ignored me until Father cleared his throat and put his hand on my shoulder. And this is my daughter, Theodosia, Lord Chudleigh. The one we spoke about.&#x201d; Ah yes!&#x201d; Lord Chudleigh bent over and peered down at me. Our newest little archaeologist, eh? Following in your mother&#x2019;s footsteps, are you, girl? Well done.&#x201d; He reached out and patted me on the head. Like a pet. I&#x2019;m sorry, but you simply don&#x2019;t go around patting people on the head like dogs!<br>Father tightened his hand on my shoulder in silent warning. So. What&#x2019;s all this I keep hearing about an artifact of your own?&#x201d; Chudleigh looked smug. After you came rushing home in such a hurry, I had to make a quick run down to Thebes to secure the site.&#x201d; Father winced slightly. So you&#x2019;ve mentioned.&#x201d; Under his breath he added, Three times.&#x201d; Then, louder, I&#x2019;m terribly sorry about that. If my son hadn&#x2019;t been so ill . . .&#x201d; Eh, it felt good to get out into the field and get a taste of what you do.&#x201d; Chudleigh nudged Father with hhhhhis elbow. I got a chance to find a little something of my own down there, too. Standing in plain sight, it was. Don&#x2019;t know why you and your wife didn&#x2019;t send it straight along with the first batch. In fact, I have a treat for everyone tonight.&#x201d; He puffed up his chest and rocked back on his heels. In honor of my most recent find, we&#x2019;re going to have a mummy unwrapping!&#x201d; A mummy unwrapping! My stomach recoiled at the very idea. Didn&#x2019;t he understand that mummification was a very sacred death rite of the ancient Egyptians? That unwrapping a mummy would be the same as undressing his grandfather&#x2019;s dead body? Sir,&#x201d; I began, but Father&#x2019;s hand pressed down on my shoulder again. Surely I was going to be bruised black and blue from all this hand clamping.<br> Fascinating, sir,&#x201d; was all he said. We&#x2019;ll look forward to it.&#x201d; Good, good. Thought you might.&#x201d; Chudleigh nodded. Father excused us, took Mother&#x2019;s and my elbows, and began to steer us away. Mum muttered under her breath, I thought unwrappings went out with Queen Victoria.&#x201d; I whirled around to Father when we were out of earshot. Why didn&#x2019;t you say something? That&#x2019;s desecration, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Yes, I suppose it is, Theodosia. But I&#x2019;m not personally responsible for every mummy that comes out of Egypt, you know. Besides, the man&#x2019;s on the museum&#x2019;s board. I can&#x2019;t risk getting on his bad side, and telling him that unwrapping his new mummy is bad form would certainly do that.&#x201d; I turned to Mother.<br> Oh, no,&#x201d; she said. Don&#x2019;t look at me. I&#x2019;ve already got a hard enough row to hoe being a woman in this field. I can&#x2019;t afford any appearance of sentimentality or emotion.&#x201d; Well, it had been worth a try. Where do you think Chudleigh found the mummy? I never saw one in the tomb or annex. Did you?&#x201d; Well, no. But then again, I was preoccupied with getting you out of there safely. Now, let&#x2019;s get this wretched evening over with. Oomph!&#x201d; Mother removed her elbow from Father&#x2019;s ribs. Tonight&#x2019;s supposed to be a treat,&#x201d; she reminded him.<br>Indeed, I had hoped for a lovely evening out with my parents. I had also hoped that my dressing up in fancy clothes and attending one of their social events might have allowed them to see me a little differently.<br>Or simply see me, rather than spend the entire evening looking over my head at other adults.<br>Pretending I hadn&#x2019;t heard them, I raised up on my tiptoes, trying to spot the mummy. I couldn&#x2019;t believe I would have overlooked a mummy lying about in plain sight, even if I had been being chased by the Serpents of Chaos. It was hopeless. There were too many people, all of whom were taller than I was. When I pulled my gaze back down, I found an elderly man examining me through his monocle as if I were a bug at the end of a pin. A very round woman dressed in mustard-colored ruffles lifted her lorgnette to the bridge of her nose, then tut-tutted. Honestly! You&#x2019;d think they&#x2019;d never seen an eleven- year-old girl before.<br> I suppose we&#x2019;d best go pay our respects to Mother.&#x201d; Father made the suggestion with the same enthusiasm he might have shown for leaping off the London Bridge straight into the foul, icy water of the river Thames.<br>Which was precisely how I felt about seeing Grandmother, frankly. Luckily, the crowd shifted just then and I spied someone I recognized. Oh look, Father! There&#x2019;s Lord Snowthorpe.&#x201d; And although he wasn&#x2019;t one of my favorite people, he was standing next to one of my favorite people, Lord Wigmere. Only, I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know Wigmere even existed, as he was the head of the Brotherhood of the Chosen Keepers, a secret organization whose sworn duty was to keep watch over all the sacred objects and artifacts in the country. Because the British Empire had amassed quite a few relics and ensorcelled items, it was quite a job. It was the Brotherhood that stood between our country and any of that ancient magic getting loose and wreaking horror upon us. Well, them and me, that is. I waved at the two men.<br> No, Theo!&#x201d; Father hissed. I don&#x2019;t wish to speak to &#x201d; Throckmorton!&#x201d; Lord Snowthorpe called out.<br> Oh, blast it all. Now look what you&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d; Didn&#x2019;t Father realize that Snowthorpe was a hundred times better than Grandmother? Besides, I was hoping one of these gentlemen might be as repulsed by the mummy unwrapping as we were. Since they didn&#x2019;t work for Lord Chudleigh, perhaps they could put a stop to it.<br>When we reached Snowthorpe, Lord Wigmere winked at me, then ever so slightly shook his head, letting me know I wasn&#x2019;t to let on I knew him. I winked back. There were a lot of false hearty hellos and good-to-see-yous exchanged, then Snowthorpe got down to his real reason for wanting to say hello: nosiness. I say, did that Heart of Egypt of yours ever turn up?&#x201d; he asked.<br>Father stiffened, and Mother raised her nose into the air. I&#x2019;m afraid not,&#x201d; she said. The burglar got clean away.&#x201d; That was a subject I wouldn&#x2019;t mind avoiding for a while longer. Say, a lifetime. My parents had no idea that I had been the one to return the Heart of Egypt to its proper resting place in the Valley of the Kings. It had been the only way to nullify the dreadful curse the artifact had been infected with. Of course, I&#x2019;d had a bit of help from Wigmere and his Brotherhood of the Chosen Keepers. But my parents didn&#x2019;t know that, either.<br> What was all that rot you fed me about having it cleaned, then?&#x201d; Snowthorpe demanded.<br> We . . .&#x201d; Father turned to Mother with a desperate look on his face. She stared back, fumbling for something to say.<br>They couldn&#x2019;t have looked more guilty if they tried, so I spoke up. The authorities had asked us to keep quiet until they made a few inquiries. They didn&#x2019;t want the perpetrators to catch wind of how much they knew or who they suspected.&#x201d; Four pairs of eyes looked down at me in surprise. Isn&#x2019;t that what they said, Father?&#x201d; Yes,&#x201d; he said, recovering nicely. Exactly what they said.&#x201d; Wigmere&#x2019;s mustache twitched. Do introduce me to this charming young lady, Throckmorton.&#x201d; As if we needed any introduction! We&#x2019;d only worked closely together on averting one of the worst crises ever to reach British soil. Forgive me. Lord Wigmere, this is my daughter, Theodosia Throckmorton. Theodosia, this is Lord Wigmere, head of the Antiquarian Society.&#x201d; I gave a proper curtsy. I&#x2019;m very pleased to meet you, sir.&#x201d; And I you.&#x201d; Before Snowthorpe could begin jawing on again about the Heart of Egypt, I decided to raise my concerns. Have you heard what Lord Chudleigh&#x2019;s planning for this evening?&#x201d; I felt Father scowl at me, but I did my best to ignore him, which was rather difficult when his heated gaze threatened to burn a hole through my skull.<br>Snowthorpe brightened. You mean the mummy unwrapping?&#x201d; Yes, but don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s wrong to do it as . . . entertainment?&#x201d; Snowthorpe dismissed my words with a wave of his hand. Gad no! It&#x2019;s good for business, that. People love mummies, and whenever their interest goes up, so do museum ticket sales.&#x201d; But isn&#x2019;t it desecration?&#x201d; The pleasant expression left Snowthorpe&#x2019;s face and he looked down at me, almost as if seeing me for the first time. You sound just like Wigmere here. He&#x2019;d have us ship all our artifacts back to Egypt if he had his way.&#x201d; Well, certainly the cursed ones, anyway. I sent a beseeching look in Wigmere&#x2019;s direction, but he shook his head sympathetically. I already tried and got nowhere. Chudleigh&#x2019;s too intent on having his fun.&#x201d; Disappointment spiked through me. I looked over my shoulder. The crowd had broken up a bit and I caught a glimpse of a table with guests clustered around it, but I still couldn&#x2019;t see the mummy itself.<br>Really, this fete of theirs was no fun at all. Not what I thought of as a proper party. I caught yet another old codger staring at me and realized that such scrutiny had made me beastly thirsty. I suddenly craved a glass of lemon smash or cold ginger beer. As I searched the crowd for the man with the refreshment tray, yet another old lady examined me through her opera glasses. I wrinkled my nose. Didn&#x2019;t these people realize how rude that was? The woman dropped her glasses, and I was dismayed to find myself staring into the shocked face of Grandmother Throckmorton! I quickly turned away, pretending I hadn&#x2019;t seen her.<br>Seconds later, a very stiff-looking footman appeared at Father&#x2019;s side. Madam wishes me to request you attend her immediately.&#x201d; What?&#x201d; he asked, then caught sight of his mother. Oh yes, of course!&#x201d; He bid goodbye to Wigmere and Snowthorpe, then herded us over to where Grandmother was conversing with a rather short, barrel-shaped man. When we reached her, she offered up her cheek to Father for a kiss. He did so (grudgingly, I&#x2019;m sure), and then she turned to Mother and inclined her head slightly. Henrietta.&#x201d; Madam.&#x201d; Mother nodded back.<br>Grandmother ignored me completely. She still wasn&#x2019;t speaking to me for having run away while under her care. Even so, I wanted to prove I could be polite even if she couldn&#x2019;t and gave my very best curtsy. How do you do, Grandmother? It&#x2019;s very good to see you again.&#x201d; Grandmother sniffed in disapproval, then asked Father, What is she doing here?&#x201d; Now, Mother. She did make a rather remarkable find, locating that secondary annex to Amenemhab&#x2019;s tomb. Lord Chudleigh suggested we bring her along to celebrate her first find for the museum.&#x201d; This is no place for children and her schedule is already far too irregular. If you cannot see to her proper upbringing, perhaps I shall take her to hand.&#x201d; Grandmother studied me for a long moment, then continued. Have you had any luck in locating a new governess for her?&#x201d; Mother and Father exchanged guilty glances. I could tell they&#x2019;d forgotten all about it. Not yet. But we&#x2019;ll keep looking.&#x201d; Mother missed the look of scorn Grandmother sent her way, but I didn&#x2019;t. I narrowed my eyes and glared at the old bat.<br> Except she was so busy ignoring me, she missed it and turned to the man standing beside her. I was left to stew on the idea of Grandmother overseeing my upbringing. I was torn between horror at the thought and fury at her treatment of Mother. Alistair, I&#x2019;d like you to meet Admiral Sopcoate.&#x201d; Admiral Sopcoate had a jolly face. He was quick to catch my eye, then smiled. I liked him immediately.<br> Admiral Sopcoate shook Father&#x2019;s hand. What is it you do, again, Throckmorton?&#x201d; Father opened his mouth to respond, but Grandmother talked over him. He&#x2019;s the Head Curator of the Museum of Legends and Antiquities.&#x201d; When Grandmother said nothing more, Father quickly stepped in. And this is my wife, Henrietta. She&#x2019;s the museum&#x2019;s archaeologist and brings us a number of our most spectacular finds.&#x201d; Grandmother sniffed.<br> And this is my daughter, Theodosia,&#x201d; Father continued.<br> Admiral Sopcoate reached out and took my hand. (No head patting or hand kissing here! I knew I liked him for a good reason.) Pleased to meet you, my dear.&#x201d; And I you, sir.&#x201d; Still determined to be on my best behavior, I added, Perhaps you&#x2019;d like to come by and see our museum someday? We&#x2019;d be happy to give you a tour.&#x201d; Grandmother...</p><h2>The Storyteller</h2><p>Becoming friends with Josef Weber, an old man who's particularly loved in her community, Sage Singer is shocked when one day he asks her to kill him and reveals why he deserves to die, causing her to question her beliefs&#x2014;and to wonder if his request would be murder or justice.

Visit her website at JodiPicoult.com.The Storyteller SAGE<p></p> <br>On the second Thursday of the month, Mrs. Dombrowski brings her dead husband to our therapy group.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s just past 3:00 p.m., and most of us are still filling our paper cups with bad coffee. I&#x2019;ve brought a plate of baked goods&#x2014;last week, Stuart told me that the reason he keeps coming to Helping Hands isn&#x2019;t the grief counseling but my butterscotch pecan muffins&#x2014;and just as I am setting them down, Mrs. Dombrowski shyly nods toward the urn she is holding. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; she tells me, &#x201c;is Herb. Herbie, meet Sage. She&#x2019;s the one I told you about, the baker.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stand frozen, ducking my head so that my hair covers the left side of my face, like I usually do. I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s a protocol for meeting a spouse who&#x2019;s been cremated, but I&#x2019;m pretty much at a loss. Am I supposed to say hello? Shake his handle?<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; I finally say, because although there are few rules to this group, the ones we have are steadfast: be a good listener, don&#x2019;t judge, and don&#x2019;t put boundaries on someone else&#x2019;s grief. I know this better than anyone. After all, I&#x2019;ve been coming for nearly three years now.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you bring?&#x201d; Mrs. Dombrowksi asks, and I realize why she&#x2019;s toting her husband&#x2019;s urn. At our last meeting, our facilitator&#x2014;Marge&#x2014;had suggested that we share a memory of whatever it was we had lost. I see that Shayla is clutching a pair of knit pink booties so tightly her knuckles are white. Ethel is holding a television remote control. Stuart has&#x2014;again&#x2014;brought in the bronze death mask of his first wife&#x2019;s face. It has made an appearance a few times at our group, and it was the creepiest thing I&#x2019;d ever seen&#x2014;until now, when Mrs. Dombrowski has brought along Herb.<br> <br>Before I have to stammer my answer, Marge calls our little group to order. We each pull a folding chair into the circle, close enough to pat someone on the shoulder or reach out a hand in support. In the center sits the box of tissues Marge brings to every session, just in case.<br> <br>Often Marge starts out with a global question&#x2014;Where were you when 9/11 happened? It gets people talking about a communal tragedy, and that sometimes makes it easier to talk about a personal one. Even so, there are always people who don&#x2019;t speak. Sometimes months go by before I even know what a new participant&#x2019;s voice sounds like.<br> <br>Today, though, Marge asks right away about the mementos we&#x2019;ve brought. Ethel raises her hand. &#x201c;This was Bernard&#x2019;s,&#x201d; she says, rubbing the television remote with her thumb. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want it to be&#x2014;God knows I tried to take it away from him a thousand times. I don&#x2019;t even have the TV this works with, anymore. But I can&#x2019;t seem to throw it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ethel&#x2019;s husband is still alive, but he has Alzheimer&#x2019;s and has no idea who she is anymore. There are all sorts of losses people suffer&#x2014;from the small to the large. You can lose your keys, your glasses, your virginity. You can lose your head, you can lose your heart, you can lose your mind. You can relinquish your home to move into assisted living, or have a child move overseas, or see a spouse vanish into dementia. Loss is more than just death, and grief is the gray shape-shifter of emotion.<br> <br>&#x201c;My husband hogs the remote,&#x201d; Shayla says. &#x201c;He says it&#x2019;s because women control everything else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s instinct,&#x201d; Stuart says. &#x201c;The part of the brain that&#x2019;s territorial is bigger in men than it is in women. I heard it on John Tesh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So that makes it an inviolable truth?&#x201d; Jocelyn rolls her eyes. Like me, she is in her twenties. Unlike me, she has no patience for anyone over the age of forty.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for sharing your memento,&#x201d; Marge says, quickly interceding. &#x201c;Sage, what did you bring today?&#x201d;<br> <br>I feel my cheeks burn as all eyes turn to me. Even though I know everyone in the group, even though we have formed a circle of trust, it is still painful for me to open myself up to their scrutiny. The skin of my scar, a starfish puckered across my left eyelid and cheek, grows even tighter than usual.<br> <br>I shake my long bangs over my eye and from beneath my tank top, pull out the chain I wear with my mother&#x2019;s wedding ring.<br> <br>Of course, I know why&#x2014;three years after my mom&#x2019;s death&#x2014;it still feels like a sword has been run through my ribs every time I think of her. It&#x2019;s the same reason I am the only person from my original grief group still here. While most people come for therapy, I came for punishment.<br> <br>Jocelyn raises her hand. &#x201c;I have a real problem with that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I blush even deeper, assuming she&#x2019;s talking about me, but then I realize that she&#x2019;s staring at the urn in Mrs. Dombrowski&#x2019;s lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s disgusting!&#x201d; Jocelyn says. &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t supposed to bring something dead. We were supposed to bring a memory.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a something, he&#x2019;s a someone,&#x201d; Mrs. Dombrowski says.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be cremated,&#x201d; Stuart muses. &#x201c;I have nightmares about dying in a fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;News flash: you&#x2019;re already dead when you&#x2019;re put into the fire,&#x201d; Jocelyn says, and Mrs. Dombrowski bursts into tears.<br> <br>I reach for the box of tissues, and pass it toward her. While Marge reminds Jocelyn about the rules of this group, kindly but firmly, I head for the bathroom down the hall.<br> <br>I grew up thinking of loss as a positive outcome. My mother used to say it was the reason she met the love of her life. She&#x2019;d left her purse at a restaurant and a sous-chef found it and tracked her down. When he called her, she wasn&#x2019;t home and her roommate took the message. A woman answered when my mom called back, and put my father on the phone. When they met so that he could give my mother back her purse, she realized he was everything she&#x2019;d ever wanted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but she also knew, from her initial phone call, that he lived with a woman.<br> <br>Who just happened to be his sister.<br> <br>My dad died of a heart attack when I was nineteen, and the only way I can even make sense of losing my mother three years later is by telling myself now she&#x2019;s with him again.<br> <br>In the bathroom, I pull my hair back from my face.<br> <br>The scar is silver now, ruched, rippling my cheek and my brow like the neck of a silk purse. Except for the fact that my eyelid droops, skin pulled too tight, you might not realize at first glance that there&#x2019;s something wrong with me&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s what my friend Mary says. But people notice. They&#x2019;re just too polite to say something, unless they are under the age of four and still brutally honest, pointing and asking their moms what&#x2019;s wrong with that lady&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>Even though the injury has faded, I still see it the way it was right after the accident: raw and red, a jagged lightning bolt splitting the symmetry of my face. In this, I suppose I&#x2019;m like a girl with an eating disorder, who weighs ninety-eight pounds but sees a fat person staring back at her from the mirror. It isn&#x2019;t even a scar to me, really. It&#x2019;s a map of where my life went wrong.<br> <br>As I leave the bathroom, I nearly mow down an old man. I am tall enough to see the pink of his scalp through the hurricane whorl of his white hair. &#x201c;I am late again,&#x201d; he says, his English accented. &#x201c;I was lost.&#x201d;<br> <br>We all are, I suppose. It&#x2019;s why we come here: to stay tethered to what&#x2019;s missing.<br> <br>This man is a new member of the grief group; he&#x2019;s only been coming for two weeks. He has yet to say a single word during a session. Yet the first time I saw him, I recognized him; I just couldn&#x2019;t remember why.<br> <br>Now, I do. The bakery. He comes in often with his dog, a little dachshund, and he orders a fresh roll with butter and a black coffee. He spends hours writing in a little black notebook, while his dog sleeps at his feet.<br> <br>As we enter the room, Jocelyn is sharing her memento: something that looks like a mangled, twisted femur. &#x201c;This was Lola&#x2019;s,&#x201d; she says, gently turning the rawhide bone over in her hands. &#x201c;I found it under the couch after we put her down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you even here?&#x201d; Stuart says. &#x201c;It was just a damn dog!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jocelyn narrows her eyes. &#x201c;At least I didn&#x2019;t bronze her.&#x201d;<br> <br>They start arguing as the old man and I get settled in the circle. Marge uses this as a distraction. &#x201c;Mr. Weber,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;welcome. Jocelyn was just telling us how much her pet meant to her. Have you ever had a pet you loved?&#x201d;<br> <br>I think of the little dog he brings to the bakery. He shares the roll with her, fifty-fifty.<br> <br>But the man is silent. He bows his head, as if he is being pressed down in his seat. I recognize that stance, that wish to disappear.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can love a pet more than you love some people,&#x201d; I say suddenly, surprising even myself. Everyone turns, because unlike the others, I hardly ever draw attention to myself by volunteering information. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter what it is that leaves a hole inside you. It just matters that it&#x2019;s there.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man slowly glances up. I can feel the heat of his gaze through the curtain of my hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Weber,&#x201d; Marge says, noticing. &#x201c;Maybe you brought a memento to share with us today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shakes his head, his blue eyes flat and without expression.<br> <br>Marge lets his silence stand; an offering on a pedestal. I know this is because some people come here to talk, while others come to just listen. But the lack of sound pounds like a heartbeat. It&#x2019;s deafening.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the paradox of loss: How can something that&#x2019;s gone weigh us down so much?<br> <br>At the end of the hour, Marge thanks us for participating and we fold up the chairs and recycle our paper plates and napkins. I pack up the remaining muffins and give them to Stuart. Bringing them back to the bakery would be like carting a bucket of water to Niagara Falls. Then I walk outside to head back to work.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;ve lived in New Hampshire your whole life, like I have, you can smell the change in the weather. It&#x2019;s oppressively hot, but there&#x2019;s a thunderstorm written across the sky in invisible ink.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn at the sound of Mr. Weber&#x2019;s voice. He stands with his back to the Episcopal church where we hold our meetings. Although it&#x2019;s at least eighty-five degrees out, he is wearing a long-sleeved shirt that is buttoned to the throat, with a narrow tie.<br> <br>&#x201c;That was a nice thing you did, sticking up for that girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>The way he pronounces the word thing, it sounds like think.<br> <br>I look away. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are Sage?&#x201d;<br> <br>Well, isn&#x2019;t that the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question? Yes, it&#x2019;s my name, but the double entendre&#x2014;that I&#x2019;m full of wisdom&#x2014;has never really applied. There have been too many moments in my life when I&#x2019;ve nearly gone off the rails, more overwhelmed by emotion than tempered by reason.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>The awkward silence grows between us like yeasted dough. &#x201c;This group. You have been coming a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know whether I should be defensive. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you find it helpful?&#x201d;<br> <br>If it were helpful, I wouldn&#x2019;t still be coming. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all nice people, really. They each just sometimes think their grief is bigger than anyone else&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t say much,&#x201d; Mr. Weber muses. &#x201c;But when you do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are a poet.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shake my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a baker.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can a person not be two things at once?&#x201d; he asks, and slowly, he walks away.<br> <br>&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;<br> <br>I run into the bakery, breathless and flushed, to find my boss hanging from the ceiling. &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;The shrine is packed and some moron in an Escalade took my spot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary&#x2019;s rigged up a Michelangelo-style dolly so that she can lie on her back and paint the ceiling of the bakery. &#x201c;That moron would be the bishop,&#x201d; she replies. &#x201c;He stopped in on his way up the hill. Said your olive loaf is heavenly, which is pretty high praise, coming from him.&#x201d;<br> <br>In her previous life, Mary DeAngelis was Sister Mary Robert. She had a green thumb and was well known for maintaining the gardens in her Maryland cloister. One Easter, when she heard the priest say He is risen, she found herself standing up from the pew and walking out the cathedral door. She left the order, dyed her hair pink, and hiked the Appalachian Trail. It was somewhere on the Presidential Range that Jesus appeared to her in a vision, and told her there were many souls to feed.<br> <br>Six months later, Mary opened Our Daily Bread at the foothills of the Our Lady of Mercy Shrine in Westerbrook, New Hampshire. The shrine covers sixteen acres with a meditation grotto, a peace angel, Stations of the Cross, and holy stairs. There is also a store filled with crosses, crucifixes, books on Catholicism and theology, Christian music CDs, saints&#x2019; medals, and Fontanini crï¿½che sets. But visitors usually come to see the 750-foot rosary made of New Hampshire granite boulders, linked together with chains.<br> <br>It was a fair-weather shrine; business dropped off dramatically during New England winters. Which was Mary&#x2019;s selling point: What could be more secular than freshly baked bread? Why not boost the revenue of the shrine by adding a bakery that would attract believers and nonbelievers alike?<br> <br>The only catch was that she had no idea how to bake.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s where I come in.<br> <br>I started baking when I was nineteen years old and my father died unexpectedly. I was at college, and went home for the funeral, only to return and find nothing the same. I stared at the words in textbooks as if they had been written in a language I could not read. I couldn&#x2019;t get myself out of bed to go to classes. I missed one exam, then another. I stopped turning in papers. Then one night I woke up in my dorm room and smelled flour&#x2014;so much flour I felt as if I&#x2019;d been rolling in it. I took a shower but couldn&#x2019;t get rid of the smell. It reminded me of Sunday mornings as a kid, when I would awaken to the scent of fresh bagels and bialys, crafted by my father.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d always tried to teach my sisters and me, but mostly we were too busy with school and field hockey and boys to listen. Or so I thought, until I started to sneak into the residential college dining hall kitchen and bake bread every night.<br> <br>I left the loaves like abandoned babies on the thresholds of the offices of professors I admired, of the dorm rooms of boys with smiles so beautiful that they stunned me into awkward silence. I left a finial row of sourdough rolls on a lectern podium and slipped a boule into the oversize purse of the cafeteria lady who pressed plates of pancakes and bacon at me, telling me I was too skinny. On the day my academic adviser told me that I was failing three of my four classes, I had nothing to say in my defense, but I gave her a honey baguette seeded with anise, the bitter and the sweet.<br> <br>My mother arrived unexpectedly one day. She took up residence in my dorm room and micromanaged my life, from making sure I was fed to walking me to class and quizzing me on my homework readings. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t get to give up,&#x201d; she told me, &#x201c;then neither do you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wound up being on the five-year plan, but I did graduate. My mother stood up and whistled through her teeth when I crossed the stage to get my diploma. And then everything went to hell.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve thought a lot about it: how you can ricochet from a moment where you are on top of the world to one where you are crawling at rock bottom. I&#x2019;ve thought about all the things I could have done differently, and if it would have led to another outcome. But thinking doesn&#x2019;t change anything, does it? And so afterward, with my eye still bloodshot and the Frankenstein monster stitches curving around my temple and cheek like the seam of a baseball, I gave my mother the same advice she had given me. If I don&#x2019;t get to give up, then neither do you.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t, at first. It took almost six months, one bodily system shutting d...</p><h2>Blame!

In autobiographical narrative that rings with experience, she describes margins as rich as dynamic abodes, places of crossing over and transition as well as spaces of separation and alienation. In reinterpreting journeys and encounters, she maps the shared terrain of the personal, social, and natural fields of our lives. She draws upon Native American sensibilities about place, relationship, and the sacred, in order to deepen our understanding of human/nature bonds, to more fully develop respect and responsibility to others, and to heal the rifts that sometimes set humans at odds with other humans and non-human creatures and threaten life on earth.</p><p>Ecotone: Wayfaring on the margins, a personal history of place, is written from the perspective of a teacher, naturalist, and feminist and uses the metaphor of the biological ecotone as the boundary where inner and outer landscape of the woman/nature continuum meet.<p>Florence R.

He grew up in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India. He studied at the universities of Delhi and Oxford and published his first novel, The Circle of Reason in 1986. He has taught at a number of institutions, most recently Harvard, and written for many publications. He currently divides his time between Calcutta, Goa and Brooklyn. The first novel in the Ibis Trilogy, Sea of Poppies, was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize.RIVER OF SMOKE (Chapter One)<p>Deeti&#x2019;s shrine was hidden in a cliff, in a far corner of Mauritius, where the island&#x2019;s western and southern shorelines collide to form the wind-whipped dome of the Morne Brabant. The site was a geological anomaly &#x2013; a cave within a spur of limestone, hollowed out by wind and water &#x2013; and there was nothing like it anywhere else on the mountain. Later Deeti would insist that it wasn&#x2019;t chance but destiny that led her to it &#x2013; for the very existence of the place was unimaginable until you had actually stepped inside it.</p><p>The Colver farm was across the bay and towards the end of Deeti&#x2019;s life, when her knees were stiff with arthritis, the climb up to the shrine was too much for her to undertake on her own: she wasn&#x2019;t able to make the trip unless she was carried up in her special pus-pus &#x2013; a contraption that was part palki and part sedan chair. This meant that visits to the shrine had to be full-scale expeditions, requiring the attendance of a good number of the Colver menfolk, especially the younger and sturdier ones.</p><p>To assemble the whole clan &#x2013; La Fami Colver, as they said in Kreol &#x2013; was never easy since its members were widely scattered, within the island and abroad. But the one time of year when everyone could be counted on to make a special effort was in midsummer, during the Gran Vakans that preceded the New Year. The Fami would begin mobilizing in mid-December, and by the start of the holidays the whole clan would be on the march; accompanied by paltans of bonoys, belsers, bowjis, salas, sakubays and other in-laws, the Colver phalanxes would converge on the farm in a giant pincer movement: some would come overland on ox-carts, from Curepipe and Quatre Borne, through the misted uplands; some would travel by boat, from Port Louis and Mahï¿½bourg,hugging the coast till they were in sight of the mist-veiled nipple of the Morne.</p><p>Much depended on the weather, for a trek up the wind-swept mountain could not be undertaken except on a fine day. When the conditions seemed propitious, the bandobast would start the night before. The feast that followed the puja was always the most eagerly awaited part of the pilgrimage and the preparations for it occasioned much excitement and anticipation: the tin-roofed bungalow would ring to the sound of choppers and chakkis, mortars and rolling-pins, as masalas were ground, chutneys tempered, and heaps of vegetables transformed into stuffings for parathas and daal-puris. After everything had been packed in tiffin-boxes and gardmanzï¿½s, everyone would be bundled off for an early night.</p><p>When daybreak came, Deeti would take it on herself to ensure that everyone was scrubbed and bathed, and that not a morsel of food passed anyone&#x2019;s lips &#x2013; for as with all pilgrimages, this too had to be undertaken with a body that was undefiled, within and without. Always the first to rise, she would go tap-tapping around the wood-floored bungalow, cane in hand, trumpeting a reveille in the strange mixture of Bhojpuri and Kreol that had become her personal idiom of expression: Revey-tï¿½! ï¿½ Banwari; ï¿½ Mukhpyari! Revey-tï¿½ na! Haglï¿½ ba?</p><p>By the time the whole tribe was up and on their feet, the sun would have set alight the clouds that veiled the peak of the Morne. Deeti would take her place in the lead, in a horse-drawn carriage, and the procession would go rumbling out of the farm, through the gates and down the hill, to the isthmus that connected the mountain to the rest of the island. This was as far as any vehicle could go, so here the party would descend. Deeti would take her seat in the pus-pus, and with the younger males taking turns at the poles, her chair would lead the way up, through the thick greenery that cloaked the mountain&#x2019;s lower slopes.</p><p>Just before the last and steepest stretch of the climb there was a convenient clearing where everyone would stop, not just to catch their breath, but also to exclaim over the manifik view of jungle and mountain, contained between two sand-fringed, scalloped lines of coast.</p><p>Deeti alone was less than enchanted by this spectacular vista. Within a few minutes she&#x2019;d be snapping at everyone: Levï¿½ tï¿½! We&#x2019;re not here to goggle at the zoli-vi and spend the day doing patati-patata. Paditu! Chal!</p><p>To complain that your legs were fatigï¿½ or your head was gidigidi was no use; all you&#x2019;d get in return was a ferocious: Bus to fana! Get on your feet!</p><p>It wouldn&#x2019;t take much to rouse the party; having come this far on empty stomachs, they would now be impatient for the post-puja meal, the children especially. Once again, Deeti&#x2019;s pus-pus, with the sturdiest of the menfolk holding the poles, would take the lead: with a rattling of pebbles they would go up a steep pathway and circle around a ridge. And then all of a sudden, the other face of the mountain would come into view, dropping precipitously into the sea. Abruptly, the sound of pounding surf would well up from the edge of the cliff, ringing in their ears, and their faces would be whipped by the wind. This was the most hazardous leg of the journey, where the winds and updraughts were fiercest. No lingering was permitted here, no pause to take in the spectacle of the encircling horizon, spinning between sea and sky like a twirling hoop. Procrastinators would feel the sting of Deeti&#x2019;s cane: Garatwa! Keep moving ...</p><p>A few more steps and they&#x2019;d reach the sheltered ledge of rock that formed the shrine&#x2019;s threshold. This curious natural formation was known to the family as the Chowkey, and it could not have been better designed had it been planned by an architect: its floor was broad and almost flat, and it was sheltered by a rocky overhang that served as a ceiling. It had something of the feel of a shaded veranda, and as if to complete the illusion, there was even a balustrade of sorts, formed by the gnarled greenery that clung to the edges of the ledge. But to look over the side, at the surf churning at the foot of the cliff, took a strong stomach and a steady head: the breakers below had travelled all the way up from Antarctica and even on a calm, clear day the water seemed to surge as though it were impatient to sweep away the insolent speck of land that had interrupted its northward flow.</p><p>Yet such was the miracle of the Chowkey&#x2019;s accidental designthat visitors had only to sit down for the waves to disappear from view &#x2013; for the same gnarled greenery that protected the shelf served also to hide the ocean from those who were seated on the floor. This rocky veranda was, in other words, the perfect place to foregather, and cousins visiting from abroad were often misled into thinking that it was this quality that had earned the Chowkey its name &#x2013; for was it not a bit of a chowk, where people could assemble? And wasn&#x2019;t it something of a chokey too, with its enclosing sides? But only a Hindi-speaking etranzer would think in that vein: any islander would know that in Kreol the word &#x2018;chowkey&#x2019; refers also to the flat disc on which rotis are rolled (the thing that is known Back There as a &#x2018;chakki&#x2019;). And there it was, Deeti&#x2019;s Chowkey, right in the middle of the rock shelf, crafted not by human hands but by the wind and the earth: it was nothing but a huge boulder that had been worn and weathered into a flat-topped toadstool of stone. Within moments of the party&#x2019;s arrival, the women would be hard at work on it, rolling out tissue-thin daal-puris and parathas and stuffing them with the delectable fillings that had been prepared the night before: finely ground mixes of the island&#x2019;s most toothsome vegetables &#x2013; purple arwi and green mouroungue, cambarï¿½-beti and wilted songe.</p><p>Several photographs from this period of Deeti&#x2019;s life have survived, including a couple of beautiful silver-gelatin daguerrotypes. In one of them, taken in the Chowkey, Deeti is in the foreground, still seated in her pus-pus, the feet of which are resting on the floor. She is wearing a sari, but unlike the other women in the frame, she has allowed the ghungta to drop from her head, baring her hair, which is a startling shade of white. Her sari&#x2019;s anchal hangs over her shoulder, weighted with a massive bunch of keys, the symbol of her continuing mastery of the Fami&#x2019;s affairs. Her face is dark and round, lined with deep cracks: the daguerrotype is detailed enough to give the viewer the illusion of being able to feel the texture of her skin, which is that of crumpled, tough, weatherworn leather. Her hands are folded calmly in her lap, but there is nothing reposeful about the tilt of her body: her lips are pursed tightly together and she is squinting fiercely at the camera. One of her eyes, dimmed by cataracts, reflects the light blankly back to the lens, but the gaze ofthe other is sharp and piercing, the colour of the pupil a distinctive grey.</p><p>The entrance to the shrine&#x2019;s inner chambers can be seen over her shoulder: it is no more than a tilted fissure in the cliffside, so narrow that it seems impossible that a cavern could lie hidden behind it. In the background, a paunchy man in a dhoti can be seen, trying to chivvy a brood of children into forming a line so that they can follow Deeti inside.</p><p>This too was an inviolable part of the ritual: it always fell to Deeti to make sure that the youngest were the first to perform the puja, so they could eat before the rest. With a cane in one hand and a branch of candles in another, she would usher all the young Colvers &#x2013; chutkas and chutkis, laikas and laikis &#x2013; straight through the hall-like cavern that led to the inner sanctum. The famished youngsters would hurry after her, scarcely glancing at the painted walls of the cave&#x2019;s outer chamber, with its drawings and graffiti. They would run to the part of the shrine that Deeti called her &#x2018;puja-room&#x2019;: a small hollow in the rock, hidden away at the back. If the shrine had been an ordinary temple, this would...</p></p><h2>Pieces of Modesty (Modesty Blaise series)</h2><p>Peter O'Donnell's first collection of short stories, <i><b>Pieces of Modesty</b></i> sees Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin travel and fight their way around the world.

Such were the cabinets of curiosities of the seventeenth century, the last period of history when man could aspire to know everything.Who were the collectors? They were archdukes and kings&#x2014;the Emperor Rudolf II was the prince of all collectors&#x2014;rich merchants and scholars, and their collections ranged from a single crowded room to whole palatial suites. Patrick Maurie`s traces the amazing history of these &#x201c;rooms of wonders&#x201d; in this ingeniously erudite survey. Not many of the rooms survive, though there are pictorial records, but their contents still exist and are among the treasures of museums all over the world.</p><p><b>Patrick Mauriï¿½s</b> is a Paris-based contributing editor to the Italian design magazine <i>FMR</i> and former literary editor of <i>Liberation</i>.In this sumptuously illustrated volume, Mauries (Jean Cocteau) presents the long history of cabinets of curiosities-grand accumulations of rare, exotic, or unusual objects either natural or human-made, displayed in decorative cases or entire rooms. The earliest documented case, from late 15th-century Italy, was a collection of books as well as a variety of botanical and zoological specimens (including a stuffed crocodile). Collections have also included textiles, scientific and musical instruments, ethnographic objects, automata, paintings, silverware, and mummified anatomical specimens. That the fascination with collecting-as well as with organizing these collections in some artistic fashion-has continued through the centuries is evident in the "shadow boxes" by 20th-century artists such as Joseph Cornell. In many ways, this book is a cabinet of curiosities in itself-crammed with fascinating images and information. While the images are the book's strength (the author is affiliated with the beautifully illustrated Italian journal FMR), some are used as background to the text, thereby either obscuring or being obscured by the printed page. Even worse, some lack captions or have captions that are erroneous. In addition, the book suffers from not having an adequate index or a glossary to help with the many foreign and esoteric terms used. Although the book is fun to browse through, it shouldn't be considered a necessary purchase.<br><i>Margaret Gross, Chicago P.L. </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bizenghast manga volume 3 (3)</h2><p>When a young girl moves to the town of Bizenghast, she discovers a group of lost souls that want to go home, and this realization tests her own sanity.</p><p></p><h2>Abiding Mission: Missionary Spirituality and Disciple-Making Among the Muslim Peoples of Egypt and Northern Sudan</h2><p>Abiding Mission presents the discipline of abiding as the first priority of the Christian and the base methodology of mission.

But this is no mere digest for undergraduates, for more advanced scholars can learn from it, too."&#x2014;<i>Pacific Historical Review</i>.</p><p>&#34;The Spanish-American war has inherent interest for students, and has received much attention in recent years.

In 1999 we will celebrate the foresight of those who, a century earlier, created Mount Rainier National Park. With that single act they protected for future generations the wild beauty of the area's alpine meadows, dramatic waterfalls and lowland forests--and the extraordinary mountain they surround. <p>In this, the official book of the centennial, Pat O'Hara and Tim McNulty view the mountain through all its facets: from the geologic and climatic forces that continue to shape it, to the rich legacy of humans' relationship with it, to its delicate ecosystems and what will be needed to protect them for the future. </p><p>Home to more than 120 alpine plant species, 3 of which are found nowhere else in the world, Mount Rainier remains a refuge for a diversity of flora and fauna. It is also a magnet for the hundreds of thousands of people who live within sight of its snowy slopes and for millions of visitors who arrive from around the world each year. O'Hara and McNulty explore the conflict this presents as park managers attempt to balance protection of the mountain's fragile ecosystems with the desires of the many who wish to seek solitude in its vast forests or challenge themselves on its daunting glaciers. Above all, this book celebrates this treasured place for anyone who has ever looked up and said, "Hey! The mountain is out!"</p></p><p>Tim McNulty is a poet, essayist, and nature writer.

Albrecht traces the connections between film designers&#39; art and its roots in European design movements, such as Art Deco and the Bauhaus. The penthouses, nightclubs, and skyscrapers that showed moviegoers a new way of living demanded a new look, which these architectural movements provided. DESIGNING DREAMS concludes with an essential chapter on The Fountainhead, modernist architecture&#39;s last fervid gasp in the movies.

Stimson: The First Wise Man (Biographies in American Foreign Policy)</h2><p>The twentieth century witnessed the rise of the United States as the preeminent player on the world stage. While many individuals were responsible for the American ascension, few have left a larger legacy in the arena of foreign policy than Henry L. Stimson. Serving nearly every American president from Theodore Roosevelt to Harry S. Truman, Stimson shaped America's worldview and influenced America's foreign affairs decisions for over 40 years. A Republican, Stimson served as Secretary of War under William H. Taft (1911-13), Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover (1929-33), and Secretary of War for Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman (1940-45); in addition, he fought in World War I, initiated the Good Neighbor Policy in Central America, and served as Governor General of the Philippines (1927-29).<br><br> In this new book, David Schmitz reveals how the life of Stimson provides a unique framework for analyzing America's foreign policy development from the imperialism of the 1890s to the origins of the Cold War and the emergence of the United States as the world's leading power after World War II. The author also explains the continuities in foreign policy over this period and the emergence of the internationalist perspective over isolation-ism, showing how Stimson was able to pass along his perspec-tives to the next generation of American policymakers who after World War II established the internationalist mindset of the Cold War years. Stimson's crucial role in the development and use of the atomic bomb is also examined. <i>Henry L. Stimson: The First Wise Man</i> is useful for courses in United States foreign policy, World War II, American history from 1900-1945, and survey courses in U.S. history.</p><p><b>David F.

His wife, Agatha, having had more than she can take, has finally walked out on him. With Jack and his equally unreliable adolescent son, Stanley, left to fend for themselves, pandemonium ensues. Full of sardonic wit and mad capers, father and son blaze a trail of drunken chaos through the city&#39;s pubs, clubs, race courses, and their own increasingly battered home. Along the way, they fall in with a weird and wondrous assortment of lowlife characters who turn up to enliven the kind of party that Mr. Gudgeon invariably intends to be a &#34;quiet, respectable turnout,&#34; but which, somehow, never is.</p><p>Lennie Lower was born in Dubbo and lived in Darlinghurst, Sydney, where, according to one of his colleagues, he learnt to write Australian &#34;as she is spoke&#34;. After leaving the navy, he served time on a number of newspapers and his witty columns made him one of the most loved characters in Australian journalism throughout the 30s and 40s. A hard-drinking, unpredictable man, he was often the despair of sub-editors and more than a handful for proprietors. Here&#39;s Luck - his only novel, published in 1930 - quickly became a bestseller. Though he died in 1947 at the age of 43, his novel remains a monument of native Australian humour that is still unsurpassed.&#34;Australia&#39;s funniest book&#34; Cyril Pearl &#34;one of the world&#39;s best humorists&#34; Daily Telegraph On Stanley &#34;I would rather rear a platypus than a boy.&#34; On Love &#34;I explained to him that, if ever he found himself getting serious with a woman, if he bashed his head against a nearby wall for about ten minutes instead, he&#39;d feel better in the long run.&#34; On Marriage &#34;I explained to him about women. I showed him a portrait of his mother as she was when I married her and left the rest to his imagination.&#34; On Tidiness &#34;One thing about Stanley, he is a methodical boy and pitches his clothes on the floor in symmetrical heaps where they can be easily turned over with the foot when anything is required.&#34; On Lying &#34;That&#39;s the trouble with me. When I get started on a lie I must carry it on. Artistic pride, I suppose. The creative instinct. I keep on adding little adornments here and refinements there until I stand on a motley but magnificent mound of pure fiction; from which nine times out of ten, my wife will pick the keystone, so to speak, and bring me swooping to earth with a smothered but undeniable crash.&#34; On Hair of the Dog &#34;A foaming pint-pot thumped wetly on the bar as I spoke and I clasped it by its big friendly handle, raised it, and the stuff swooped down my throat bearing a message of hope to my dejected internals. I replaced the pot, empty, on the bar and sighed - one of those deep, satisfactory sighs that seem to start from one&#39;s boots, gather all the little cares and troubles on the way, and from the mouth dissipate in the air.&#34; On Women &#34;I know women. Know one of them and you know all of them. Of course, there are remarkable differences in women, but they can be likened to motor-cars. Different models, different qualities, but they all work by means of internal combustion.&#34; On Bookmakers &#34;I fully realize, as a good citizen, that private property is sacred and that no man should be robbed except by proper business methods, but somehow the sporting malefactors of this world appeal to me more than people like my rotten landlord, who goes to church on Sunday and has the damned hide to call for rent on Monday.&#34; On Parties &#34;It is my opinion that if there is no fight at a party, the party isn&#39;t a success. Parties have degenerated these days. The old time shivoos and picnics where there was tea and scandal for the women, and ginger-beer and sticky toffee for the kids, and beer and fights for the men, were better than the modern version. A fight livens up the evening and weeds out the undesirables, and if modern hostesses only had the enterprise to arrange a brawl among the guests, the present boredom of the social round would not exist.&#34;</p><h2>Vintage cocktails: Authentic recipes and illustrations from 1920-1960</h2><p>Smithmark is proud to introduce this comprehensive, nostalgia-rich guide filled with over 100 authentic, timeless cocktail recipes, complete with the entertaining, informative history of each drink.

Cass took a moment to stretch, her muscles grateful to be free of the cramped enclosure. After Luca had torn open his shoulder escaping from the Doge&#x2019;s dungeons, the wound had festered, leaving him feverish and incapacitated for nearly a week. Cass knew each day that passed meant fewer people would be searching for them, but the waiting had been agony. She was desperate to resume her quest to destroy the Order of the Eternal Rose.<br>&nbsp;There was only one way to do that&#x2014;find the Book of the Eternal Rose and pray it contained enough evidence of wrongdoing to bring the Order&#x2019;s members to justice. Hatred coiled inside of Cass like a tangle of serpents. She embraced it, channeled it toward the task at hand. &#x201c;The shore is this way,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;Luca squeezed her fingers as they turned off the path, and she relaxed slightly. The whispering tide ebbed and flowed just out of sight. The wind was warm but brisk, whipping the fabric of her dress up around her legs. Luca walked stiffly, his injured arm cradled against his torso. They traveled east along the water until Cass found what she was looking for&#x2014;an old batï¿½la tied to a wooden dock. She glanced around. A handful of cottages&#x2014;all dark&#x2014;stood nearby. The boat might belong to any of them.<br>&nbsp;Walking boldly out onto the dock, Cass knelt down and loosened the rope that moored the small rowboat. &#x201c;Get in,&#x201d; she told Luca.<br>&nbsp;He paused. &#x201c;Is there no other way than to steal from peasants?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Our alleged crimes have gone beyond mere theft,&#x201d; Cass said. She didn&#x2019;t remind him that they were heading to Villa Querini so they could steal from her beloved aunt. There was no other way. Cass and Luca would need money to return to Florence and seek out the book. It was safer for Agnese if she believed they were dead. &#x201c;Besides, someone will probably find the craft and return it.&#x201d; Nimbly, Cass&#x2019;s fingers worked through the knots while Luca watched with a mixture of surprise and admiration.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I had no idea your talents were so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. varied,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;Cass smiled. It felt like the first smile in days. &#x201c;Wait until you see me row.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;And row she did. Wood ground against metal as she pulled the oars, leaning into each stroke, her muscles burning in protest as the boat moved slowly and steadily through the lagoon. She scanned the water as she rowed, looking for other craft, for boats that held soldiers, for anything out of the ordinary. But the night was a curtain of blackness, with nothing but a hazy moon to guide her. If they suddenly came upon another boat, there very well might be a crash.<br>&nbsp;Luca took in each of her movements, the expression on his face suddenly making Cass feel shy.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked. She looked down at the water, her eyes tracing the path of the wooden oar as it cut through the lagoon, before letting her gaze return to her fiancï¿½. He was still watching her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re staring.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I was thinking that each time I feel I know you, you surprise me again.&#x201d; His voice was low but full of warmth, like if he were feeling a bit stronger, he might lean over and kiss her.<br>&nbsp;Cass fumbled one of the oars at that thought. As she reached out to retrieve it, she remembered a trip in a batï¿½la she&#x2019;d made with Falco. It was the night they had found the body of Sophia, Joseph Dubois&#x2019;s former servant. Cass&#x2019;s cheeks grew hot as she thought of Falco tugging at fabric and undoing laces, at the two of them tangled together beneath a blanket as their mouths tasted each other. Idiota, she cursed herself. She was certainly full of surprises. Unfortunately, not all of them would make Luca look at her with such tenderness.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting to get winded. You should let me take a turn,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;Cass shook her head. She&#x2019;d force herself to row until her back was breaking and her hands were bleeding before she did that. Luca would reinjure his shoulder if he tried, and besides, she deserved to suffer. She had dishonored him with Falco. She had put her handmaid in harm&#x2019;s way, and Siena had died. Cass didn&#x2019;t know if she would ever forgive herself.<br>&nbsp;She followed the southern coastline of the Giudecca around to the east and then turned south before reaching San Giorgio Maggiore. The shore of San Domenico appeared out of the mist, its tall grass blowing back and forth as if beckoning to her. Cass navigated the boat past an open field and around to Agnese&#x2019;s dock. She looped a coil of rope around one of the mooring posts. Tying what she hoped was a secure knot, Cass rose slowly to her feet in the wobbling craft.<br>&nbsp;Luca took her arm and steadied her as she alighted from the boat. She turned to give him her hand as he stepped from the batï¿½la after her.<br>&nbsp;They stood at the edge of the dock, uncertain, a pair of silhouettes backlit by the moon. Cass couldn&#x2019;t believe she was home again. It had been only a week, but the place felt alien to her. Patches of the normally neatly manicured lawn were unkempt, the shrubbery that framed the front of the villa beginning to overtake the grass. Her knees went a bit quivery, and her heart rose into her throat. Giuseppe had never neglected his gardening duties. What did it mean?<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Cass? What is it?&#x201d; Luca asked.<br>&nbsp;Rather than explain why the unruly hedges seemed a harbinger of bad tidings, Cass stepped from the dock onto the lawn. Luca was close behind her. As she neared the front door, she could see the draperies of black fabric that covered the door and all of the windows.Draperies that meant someone was dead.<br>&nbsp;A shudder moved through Cass. She reached out for the carved molding around the door to steady herself, trying to deny to her brain what her heart was screaming. Her aunt was fine&#x2014;she had to be. For all Cass knew, the swatches of fabric might be for her. Perhaps after failing to locate them, the Senate had declared Cass and Luca dead. Agnese could have hung the ceremonial draperies to honor Cass, despite having no body to bury.<br>&nbsp;Luca rested a hand on her back. His touch gave her the strength to move forward, but the front door was locked, the villa completely quiet. Cass didn&#x2019;t know what she&#x2019;d been expecting. It was late&#x2014;of course the place would be secure. She wondered who might answer the door if she knocked. Bortolo, the butler, had been Agnese&#x2019;s servant for more than twenty years, but age had taken its toll and Cass had no doubt he was dozing somewhere. Agnese&#x2019;s handmaid, Narissa, might still be lurking about, mending chemises by candlelight.<br>&nbsp;But Cass couldn&#x2019;t knock. Even though she thought of the servants as family, she and Luca were criminals, with large bounties on their heads. She had to assume that anyone would turn them in for a life-changing amount of gold. Men had betrayed their real families for much less.<br>&nbsp;Instead, Cass led Luca around to the back of the villa, to the garden, where she was dismayed to find that Agnese&#x2019;s rosebushes looked as if they hadn&#x2019;t seen water in days. The stems were gnarled and twisted, like witches&#x2019; fingers; the blooms hung low. Even the marigolds had withered, their petals littering the dirt like a field of golden teardrops.<br>&nbsp;Luckily, the servants&#x2019; door was unlocked, and Cass and Luca slipped quietly into the kitchen. And then she knew for certain. It wasn&#x2019;t merely the faint smell of decay, masked by rosewater and the tinge of something medicinal. It was a feeling that overwhelmed her the instant she set foot inside the villa. A feeling of emptiness.<br>&nbsp;A feeling of death.</p><h2>Celtic: Myths &amp; Legends Ser (Myths and Legends)</h2><p>A collection of Celtic tales centering on the myths and legends of Ireland and Wales and including accounts of Celtic customs and religious beliefs</p><p></p><h2>Leaving Before the Rains Come</h2><p>May have some wear on cover.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2015:</strong> The key to a great memoir may be less in the story it tells than in the voice and eye of the storyteller. In <i>Leaving Before the Rains Come</i>, Alexandra Fuller&#x2019;s third memoir (she also wrote two other books of nonfiction), the author confirms what readers of <i>Don&#x2019;t Let&#x2019;s Go to the Dogs Tonight</i> detected on first reading of that debut: Fuller belongs in the pantheon of great memoirists, right alongside Mary Karr, Tobias Wolff, and Frank McCourt. Not unlike those writers, Fuller has a single trope &#x2013; hers is a childhood spent as a British expat on a farm in revolution-torn southern Africa &#x2013; that she uses over and over to define and clarify her life The title expression, for example, is a south Africanism for &#x201c;get out while you can,&#x201d; and throughout this heartfelt book, she uses experiences, images and memories from her twenty years in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, and from the people she knew there, to illustrate more contemporary and local places and states of mind. Here, the focus is on the men in her life &#x2013; for one, her heavy-drinking, plain-talking, fatalistic father who says thing like &#x201c;Those who talk the most, usually have the least to say.&#x201d; The other is Charlie, her now-ex-husband, an American mainline Philadelphia neo-cowboy who seems at first to be the perfect strong-and-sensitive type, all pragmatism to her barely controlled (but charming) chaos. While the book is ostensibly about their union, and its ultimate dissolution, it is also about memory and childhood and nature and modern life. Charlie and &#x201c;Bobo&#x201d; (Fuller&#x2019;s family nickname, though she is sometimes also called &#x201c;Al&#x201d;) live together through elephant attacks (on their first date), malaria (on their wedding day) and relocation (from the wilds of Africa to the tamer wilds of Wyoming) but it is a more prosaic disaster that fells them: the real estate crash of 2008. What exactly went on emotionally between Charlie and Bobo is never fully explained &#x2013; if you asked her, I&#x2019;d bet she&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s because she is still trying to figure it out &#x2013; but the chords of loss she strikes resonate loudly and universally. Still, this is not a depressing book, thanks largely to Fuller&#x2019;s winsome wit (she thought &#x201c;mainline Philadelphia&#x201d; meant that Charlie&#x2019;s people were heroin addicts who happened to live in Pennsylvania) and unabashed admissions: she had nine novels rejected by publishers before figuring out she should write nonfiction. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine there&#x2019;s much more for Fuller to say about her life &#x2013; and yet, I might have said that after the last memoir. Somehow, always, she finds another thread to weave into another masterpiece. <i>--Sara Nelson</i></p>ALEXANDRA FULLER was born in England in 1969.

In these selections, Huxtable examines the twentieth century's most important architectural masters and projects, cataloging the seismic shifts in style, function, and fashion that have led to the dramatic new architecture of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><b>Ada Louise Huxtable</b>, former <i>New York Times</i> critic, winner of the first Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criticism, and MacArthur and Guggenheim Fellow, is currently the architecture critic for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. She is recognized as the founder of contemporary architectural journalism. Her books include <i>The Unreal America: Architecture and Illusion</i>, <i>Kicked a Building Lately?</i> and, most recently, a short biography of Frank Lloyd Wright for the Penguin Lives series. She served for many years on the juries of the Pritzker Architecture Prize and the American Committee of the Japanese Praemium Imperiale. She lives in New York City and Marblehead, Mass.<p>&#x201c;<i>On Architecture</i>, a career-spanning collection of articles and essays, demonstrates that she has always pursued her mission with reason, elegance and wisdom. Huxtable's work remains the gold standard of criticism--and not just the architectural variety--because she brings to the job a rare combination of aesthetic certitude and roving curiosity ... Review by review, essay by persuasive essay, she erects an impressive structure supported by the force of sheer reasonableness. She applauds economy but detests cheapness, appreciates expressivity but abhors showiness, and above all demands that a building make sense. For a colleague less than half her age, it is awesome to observe her pronouncing judgment on elements of New York City that have come to seem immemorial.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;For all of Huxtable's palpable love of the art of design, she never loses sight of architecture's uniquely high stakes. Whether the topic is tall towers or building ornamentation, Frank Gehry or Donald Trump, the backdrop is the real-world implications of what takes shape. Huxtable never played the role of detached observer, the intellectual who looks with contempt on how and where most Americans live...From the start, Huxtable has expressed this better than anyone else. If we're lucky, she'll do so for some time to come.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>&#x201c;She can not only make us feel a great loss when a fine building is demolished, she can make us see how valuable it is when a fine new building goes up.

Its joys are common to us all.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>American Scholar</i></p><p>&#x201c;The release of <i>On Architecture: Collected Reflections on a Century of Change</i> by Ada Louise Huxtable is cause for joy. As a crusading architecture critic for The New York Times in the 1960s and '70s, and the first full-time architecture critic at any newspaper in the United States, Ms. Huxtable invented architecture criticism as we know it.

This book presents a powerful critique of current views and techniques, and proposes a new approach to interviewing. At the heart of Elliot Mishler&#x2019;s argument is the notion that an interview is a type of discourse, a speech event: it is a joint product, shaped and organized by asking and answering questions.</p><p>This view may seem self-evident, yet it does not guide most interview research. In the mainstream tradition, the discourse is suppressed. Questions and answers are regarded as analogues to stimuli and responses rather than as forms of speech; questions and the interviewer&#x2019;s behavior are standardized so that all respondents will receive the same &#x201c;stimulus&#x201d;; respondents&#x2019; social and personal contexts of meaning are ignored. While many researchers now recognize that context must be taken into account, the question of how to do so effectively has not been resolved. This important book illustrates how to implement practical alternatives to standard interviewing methods.</p><p>Drawing on current work in sociolinguistics as well as on his own extensive experience conducting interviews, Mishler shows how interviews can be analyzed and interpreted as narrative accounts. He places interviewing in a sociocultural context and examines the effects on respondents of different types of interviewing practice. The respondents themselves, he believes, should be granted a more extensive role as participants and collaborators in the research process.</p><p>The book is an elegant work of synthesis&#x2015;clearly and persuasively written, and supported by concrete examples of both standard interviewing and alternative methods. It will be of interest to both scholars and clinicians in all the various fields for which the interview is an essential tool.</p></p><p>Interviews hold a prominent place among research methods in the social and behavioral sciences . This book examines current views and practices of interviewing and conclude that they reflect a restricted conception of the interview process. This view obscures the essence of interviewing that it is an occasion of two persons speaking to each other and undercuts the potential and special contribution of interviewing for theoretical understanding of human action and experience.Elliot G.

She lives in the pueblo of San Ildefonso, near Santa Fï¿½, New Mexico, and although her life has been, as closely as she could make it, the normal life of a woman of her culture, her unusual qualities have set her apart and gained her fame throughout the world.</p><p>Through her mastery of pottery-making, Marï¿½a brought economic gain to her family and her village. However, distressing problems accompanied success and fame. Liquor ultimately wrecked Julï¿½an. There was dissension within the pueblo. And there was the succession of admiring white people who invaded her home and interrupted her work. Not least, in Marï¿½a view, was the departure of her own children from many Pueblo customs.</p><p>Inextricably woven into the story of Marï¿½a is the story of the pottery of the Southwestern Pueblos, a native craft that has become a national art interest, including the development of the unique black-on-black ware by Juliï¿½n, the first of which is reproduced among the illustrations.</p><p>Margaret Lefranc&#x2019;s many accurate drawings of actual pieces of pottery provide an almost complete documentary history of the craft and show some of the finest examples of Marï¿½a&#x2019;s art.

As 12-year-old Milton Daub braves the 1888 snowstorm in the Bronx, the sound of icy, howling winds and cracking trees enhances the experience. The narrator maintains the tension throughout with a tight, slightly hushed reading that seems to slip free from the simplicity of the accompanying easy-reader text. The pacing, slow and resolute as Milton moves determinedly on his mission, rushes forward when the situation becomes dire. The excitement, danger and heroism of Milton&#39;s day of rescue and delivery in the storm will cause young listeners to wish for their own blizzards. T.B.

They Met At Gettysburg offers its drama and insight to a new generation of Americans.</p><h2>The Medieval Calendar Year</h2><p><p><em>The Medieval Calendar Year</em> celebrates the pictorial convention known as "The Labors of the Months" and the ways it was used in the Middle Ages. Richly illustrated and elegantly presented, it provides valuable insights into prevailing social attitudes and values and will fascinate all readers who are interested in the history and culture of medieval Europe.</p><p>The "Labors" cycle was most popular during the High Middle Ages (ca. 1200&#x2013;1500). The traditional cycle depicts the year as a round of seasonal activities on the land. Each month has its allotted task, and each of these represents one stage in the never-ending process of providing food for society. The small scenes that made up the cycle were well-known and used widely throughout Europe. They were chosen to decorate both public and private spaces: churches and houses, town fountains, baptismal fonts, as well as books of devotion intended both for priests and for the laity. The cycle was sculpted in stone, carved in wood, painted on glass and on manuscript pages. Examples from such media are described, but most of the illustrations have been taken from manuscripts, primarily Books of Hours.</p><p>The author has spent the past fifteen years studying calendar after calendar, and one of her great strengths is her ability to see the social reality that lies hidden, even masked, behind the stylized presentation. In the chapter on winter, she shows how the image of this season, dreaded in the Middle Ages, was softened and sweetened by calendar artists to bring it more into harmony with the characteristic mood of the cycle as a whole. For autumn, she reveals how depictions of the harvest of grain, grapes, and livestock hint at a sophisticated market economy. Thematic chapters on children, women, and the hardship of work brilliantly cut through idealized conventions and assumptions to unveil the underlying complexities of life. </p><p>The "Labors" cycle and its social context have not hitherto been examined in depth and with the care they deserve. <em>The Medieval Calendar Year </em>is a book worthy of the beautiful and beguiling tradition it describes.</p></p><p><p>Bridget Ann Henisch is the author of <em>Fast and Feast: Food in Medieval Society </em>(1976) and the co-author, with Heinz K. Henisch, of <em>Positive Pleasures: Early Photography and Humor </em>(1998), T<em>he Painted Photograph, 1839&#x2013;1914: Origins, Techniques, Aspirations</em> (1996), <em>The Photographic Experience, 1839&#x2013;1914: Images and Attitudes</em> (1994), all from Penn State.</p>Calendars with appealing scenes or pictures are not an invention of Hallmark. Medieval calendar art routinely depicted seasonal themes, motifs, and the Zodiac. Henisch, the author of several books on photography and two books on medieval life, provides a study of the medieval themes of seasons and peasant lifestyle portrayed in the medieval calendars. Contemporary writings provide some insights into the medieval fascination for gardening and agriculture, as well as themes of leisure activities and feasting. The pastoral scenes and idyllic lifestyle of the poor peasants were hardly true to fact, however, as Henisch points out in his conversational but well-researched texts. The appendix of medieval calendar formats would have been more appropriate as an introduction. Recommended for larger collections.

Indeed, phrases that capture this notion abound in the popular vernacular: "negative energy," "dumping," "you could cut the tension with a knife." <i>The Transmission of Affect</i> deals with the belief that the emotions and energies of one person or group can be absorbed by or can enter directly into another.The ability to borrow or share states of mind, once historically and culturally assumed, is now pathologized, as Teresa Brennan shows in relation to affective transfer in psychiatric clinics and the prevalence of psychogenic illness in contemporary life. To neglect the mechanism by which affect is transmitted, the author claims, has serious consequences for science and medical research.Brennan's theory of affect is based on constant communication between individuals and their physical and social environments. Her important book details the relationships among affect, energy, and "new maladies of the soul," including attention deficit disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, codependency, and fibromyalgia.</p></p><p>The late Teresa Brennan was Schmidt Distinguished Professor of Humanities at Florida Atlantic University. Her books include Exhausting Modernity: Ground for a New Modernity and The Interpretation of the Flesh: Freud and Femininity.<p>"Brennan challenges what she views as a uniquely Western myth, that individuals are discrete and self-contained, with affect driven primarily from endogenous sources. Instead, she argues, humans absorb emotions that originate from others and that influence their very physiology and experience. This argument challenges the boundaries that are often assumed to exist between the self and the environment, between subject and object."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Transmission of Affect</i> is subtle, innovative, and trenchant. It provokes fresh questions about the relations of mind and body and it proposes original answers. Teresa Brennan's charged and lucid prose makes us understand our experiences in new ways."</p> (Gillian Beer, author of <i>Darwin's Plots: Evolutionary Narrative in Darwin, George Eliot, and Nineteenth-Century Fiction</i>)<br><br><p>"In this rich and provocative book, Teresa Brennan has developed an alternative theory of affect that challenges any notion of self-contained individuals. Her theory of the transmission of affect insists on a constant communication between individuals and their environments, with social pressure acting at the intersection of the social and the material to bring together mind and matter through energetics. A well-thought-out and clearly argued treatise that gives credence to some popular ideas about energy, <i>The Transmission of Affect</i> will shake up many of the ideas that are in vogue in the academic establishment&#x2015;part of the reason that it is such an exciting book."</p> (Kelly Oliver, Stony Brook University, author of <i>Witnessing: Beyond Recognition</i>)<br><br><p>"It is truly exciting to read something so far beyond the usual scholarly projects: the scope of this highly original book is quite revolutionary and the erudition and historical research by which Teresa Brennan advances her argument are impressive."</p> (Linda Martï¿½n Alcoff, Syracuse University)</p><h2>The German-Jewish Legacy in America, 1938-1988: From Bildung to the Bill of Rights (Jewish Holocaust Studies)</h2><p><p>The essays in this volume were written to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Kristallnacht, the fateful pogrom in early November 1938 which was a<br>watershed in the treatment of Jews in Germany and signaled the end to<br>more than a century of specific Jewish culture there.</p><p>Historian George Mosse in the opening essay characterizes this spirit as represented by Bildung, a post-emancipation notion that included<br>character formation, moral education, the primacy of culture, the acquisition of aesthetic taste, and the belief in the potential of humanity.

The image of man as a cross between Pascal's "thinking reed" and Falstaff's "forked radish," that Medawar invokes with the title to his autobiography, stems from his humble desire "not to claim for myself as an author any distinction more extravagant than membership of the human race." Yet in this incisive and witty memoir, Medawar reveals the events of an exceptional life, depicting his early days in Rio de Janeiro, his education at Oxford in the 1930s, the rewards and frustrations of his medical career, his musical education, his illnesses and recovery, his travels, and much more.

As Separatists, the Smythes believe in practicing their faith in daily life, and their first year in North America gives them ample opportunity to do that. The family reappears in Dream Seekers, although John and Sarah are now grown and their brother Phillip, 12, is front and center. Pioneers has the inherent drama of the desperate fight to survive in alien surroundings, but is weakened by a tendency to substitute descriptions of physical attributes for character development; mixed in is some degree of telling rather than showing. Dream Seekers has more convincing characterization, although Mr. Smythe is drawn as substantially more stern by Lough than by Reece. Seekers also has uneven plotting, with characters appearing, disappearing, and reappearing randomly. The Roger Williams tie-in of the subtitle is all but dropped about one-fourth of the way through.

The book opens and closes inside the mind of Frida K., at 46, on her deathbed, taking us through a kaleidoscope of memories and hallucinations where we shiver for two hundred pages on the threshold of life and death, dream and reality, truth and myth. Defiant and uncompromising, Frida bears the wounds of her body and spirit with a stark pride, transcending all limitations, wrapping her senses around the places, events, and conversations in her past. Frida K. interacts from her hospital bed with her mother, sister, Diego, and her nurse. She calls herself a "water woman," navigating into unexplored dimensions of her world, leading us through the alleys of San Francisco&#x2019;s Chinatown, of Paris in 1939 (where she rubbed shoulders with Andrï¿½ Breton), and of her neighborhood in Mexico City, Coyoacan. Her voyage is an inward one, an incantation before dying. In The Incantation of Frida K., Braverman&#x2019;s language dances and spins. She carves out a bold interpretation of the life of an artist to whom she is vitally connected.</p><p>KATE BRAVERMAN is a native of Los Angeles who grew up surrounded by the counterculture of San Francisco. She has published several novels, including The Incantation of Frida K. (2002), Wonders of the West (1993), Palm Latitudes (1988), and Lithium for Medea (1979), books of poetry&#x2014;Postcards from August (1990), Hurricane Warnings (1987), Lullaby for Sinners (1980), and Milkrun (1977)&#x2014;and a collection of stories, Squandering the Blue (1990). She won the O. Henry Award in 1992.Poet, short story writer and novelist Braverman (Lithium for Medea) delivers a wildly energetic, nearly hallucinatory account of Frida Kahlo, Mexican painter and wife of Diego Rivera. Frida is 46 and on her deathbed, addicted to morphine, Demerol, cigarettes and alcohol, and missing one leg from an amputation. Her memory is acute, though her chronology is foggy; in ecstatic prose she recounts the salient events of her adult life. At the age of 17, she suffers a horrific trolley accident and is impaled by a metal pole, which leaves her sterile, mutilated and more or less a pariah. Diego Rivera, the famous painter of monumental public works, notices her when she brings him lunches on his scaffolding; they marry and he transforms her into an international Marxist statement, parading her around the world in childlike peasant costumes. They are a wealthy, notorious "vaudeville team": Diego, ambitious and chronically unfaithful, belittles Frida's own paintings as "less than postcards," while foulmouthed Frida, raw from pain and addiction, scorns him as having the "heart of a butcher." Braverman keeps her jagged narrative from self-destructing by adhering to specific themes: Frida's desire for a daughter, as well as her personal and professional excoriation. Braverman's portrait of the "vanished woman" including her cartoonish recreation of encounters Frida allegedly has with Trotsky and his wife may put some readers off, but her work is commendably bold and strenuously imaginative, as befits her iconic subject. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lights Camera Faith Cycle B: A Movie Lectionary</h2><p>This second volume of Lights, Camera ...

In his approach to the study of colour in Islamic art, Trevathan creates meaningful dialogue between artistic production, artistic media, and the intellectual, aesthetic and philosophical concepts relating to the subject. Here, he proposes an enlightened new approach to the way we consider colour in Islamic art and architecture. Examining works in relation to their aesthetic contexts, he reveals the relevance of choice colours used in artworks, which in turn provides insights into the pre-modern Muslim experience of colour and aesthetics.<br>The seventeenth-century Masjid-i Shah mosque in Isfahan, Iran, represents one of the finest examples of colour-use on a grand scale. The building of Masjid-i Shah emerged alongside, or as a result of, a culmination of writings on light and colour by some of the most important scholars in Islamic and Persian history. Trevathan examines the philosophical and mystical traditions that formed the backdrop of the Masjid-i Shah, revealing the differences in how such artworks were conceptualized at the time of creation and how they are received today.<br>Through addressing the artistic production of this masterpiece of Islamic architecture, Trevathan shows that the careful combination of colour and design proportions in Islamic patterns expresses knowledge beyond those perceived in the corporeal world. This includes how the experience of bright and luminous colours may have served an epistemological function leading towards a noetic understanding of God. This suggests that a broader consideration of Islamic aesthetics is required, one that encompasses the potential for sensual experience to prompt a journey beyond sentient knowledge.</p><p>Idries Trevathan is a curator and conservator with more than a decade&#x2019;s experience working with Islamic art collections in the Muslim world and beyond, including the Islamic Arts Museum in Malaysia. Treyathan works regularly on conservation projects and has conducted technical and aesthetic colour studies on a range of Islamic art objects, including the Malay Qur&#x2019;an manuscripts, Damascene reception rooms and Ottoman porticoes in the grand mosque in Mecca. Trevathan trained as an art conservator at the City &amp; Guilds of London Art School and earned a PhD in colour in Islamic art from the Prince&#x2019;s Foundation School of Traditional Arts, London. His achievements have been recognised by numerous awards, including the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies Prize for Research, the Hamad bin Khalifa Scholarship, the Zibby Garnett Fellowship and the Knights of the Round Table Award.INTRODUCTION <br>The celebrated art historian John Gage offers the brilliant, but seemingly evident assertion that colour in art is the &#x2018;&#x2018;most vivid surviving manifestation of general attitudes to colour expressed in visual form.&#x2019;&#x2019; Because our experience of colour has always been commonplace, he proposes that it is through art that one can understand historic colour value and meanings. In many ways, this book is an exploration and discussion of the above statement. The assertion that the artwork can be used to understand more about "general attitudes to colour" presents an interesting idea in relation to this book which also looks at a work of art and the materials used to create it with the aim of trying to understand the contexts that frame the aesthetic experience of colour within the premodern Islamic world. Consequently, this work attempts to shed light on the experience of the viewer, as well as attitudes towards colour, aesthetics and the intellectual background. This enquiry into the aesthetic experience of colour is pursued in order to understand more fully the particular use of colour in a work of art and the implications of the premodern Muslim aesthetic experience of colour more generally.<br>Research into colour meaning in Islamic art is worthy of greater attention. Certain aspects of the subject have occasionally engaged the attention of historians: for instance in 2009, some of the world&#x2019;s leading Islamic art historians were brought together to explore the subject further, at the Hamad Bin Khalifa Biennial Conference 'And Diverse are their Hues: Colour in Islamic Art and Culture&#x2019;. The common approach at this conference was to address colour in Islamic art in terms of historical, sociological and enumerative perspectives; however some speakers looked at colour from other aspects, in particular, Samir Mahmoud, who drew on a range of exegesis of Qur&#x2019;anic verses that explicitly refer to colour. Particular reference was made to the Sufi commentaries on the nature of colour by Islamic philosophers such as Najmuddin Kubra (13th century) and Alludawlah Simnani (14th century) in their phenomenology of colours. Mahmoud paid particular attention to Henry Corbin&#x2019;s ground-breaking work on these authors in his The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism and other essays where Corbin explores, amongst other things, parallels between these Sufi texts and Goethe&#x2019;s &#x2018;Farbenlehre. Mahmoud asked the pertinent question, central to this work, do such theoretical treatises on colour reveal anything about the use and meaning of colour in Islamic art? It was not Mahmoud's intention to provide a final answer to the question, but to contribute to the debate and, in his words, to '&#x2019;rehearse many of the arguments put forward by Henry Corbin with the intention of placing his work on colour theory back in the limelight after years of neglect&#x2019;'. Despite their invitation for further research in this area, the subject has remained largely unexplored. <br>Interestingly, more than anyone it is John Gage who, although he has not focused specifically on Islamic art, has furthered the study of colour in art by providing clear and coherent commentaries on a historical understanding of colour in his two books Color and Meaning: Art, Science, and Symbolism and Colour and Culture: Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction. These two volumes necessarily span a wide range of issues including Greek colour theory, mosaics, stained glass, heraldry, the rainbow, colour vocabulary, chemistry of pigments, and correlation of colour with music. A notable success in Gage&#x2019;s work, which this study attempts to replicate, was his capacity to consider the wider context by investigating how various colour disciplines, in particular scientific and philosophical, were once incorporated and interrelated through art. Although his interest in Islamic visual culture was only fleeting, his ability to bring a more nuanced understanding to this topic can be attributed to his multi-disciplinary approach which is founded on his brilliant assertion that because premodern man&#x2019;s experience of colour was commonplace and available to most people, &#x2018;&#x2019;It is an aesthetic intent which gave it value. It is in pictures, or when we see in terms of pictures, that these colour relationships take on coherence. Hence the central importance of art for the study of colour in the larger social context.&#x201d; Therefore, although Gage was primarily interested in investigating colour meaning in art, he hypothesized that since colour has a vivid life outside the realm of art its problems, even within the realm of art, cannot be understood exclusively from within the history and theory of art itself. Thus he suggests that, at least in respect to colour, theory and history must be seen to be part of a larger picture. <br>It would seem natural to assume that examining art in relation to the larger picture, including contemporary texts, in order to consider the intellectual context of the period in question would be the bread and butter for any art historian and yet, in relation to colour, this approach is surprisingly novel in the study of Western art and uncommon in the study of Islamic art. Referencing the wider historical, social and cultural contexts is not only applicable, but highly pertinent to the study of colour in Islamic art since very little is available in the way of artistic and aesthetic treatises. Yet few attempts have been made to discover the relationship between an Islamic understanding of colour and what is evident in the works of art themselves. This begs the question as to whether using the artwork itself to look at colour perception might enable scholars to understand ways in which premodern Muslims expressed ideas about colour from within their own aesthetic context. <br>In order to address this question, the present work aims to reassess colour in Islamic art by examining the phenomenon from a more integrated perspective, one that attempts to understand it in relation to the Islamic artists&#x2019; worldview in ways similar to those used by Gage in his work. The work of Gage thus presents a model, not only in relation to his findings on colour in art and culture, but also his integrative approach that draws on a range of intellectual and historical disciplines including science, philosophy, religion and art. Thus using the artwork itself to look at aesthetic contexts in relation to colour will enable this study to further understand the ways premodern Muslims may have understood and engaged with colour in art.<br>The scope of this book is at the same time broad and intentionally limited. Broad, because it looks at colour, which is a phenomenon forming part of basic human experience, by examining ideas, objects and buildings that span continents and large swathes of history, and limited, because the scope of the subject of colour is so vast as to make any exhaustive treatment unattainable. The intention here is not to make a detailed analysis of the origin and development of colour theories throughout Islamic history, but rather, to examine Islamic ideas about colour through the prism of one building; the 17th century Masjid-i Shah in Isfahan. Chosen on the basis of representing one of the finest examples of colour use on a grand scale anywhere, this mosque bears witness to a long and celebrated tile making tradition that possessed a highly sophisticated knowledge of the laws of colour both technically and aesthetically. According to the great historian of Persia Arthur Pope, the saturation and intensity of harmonious colours found on the Masjid-i-Shah (Shah Mosque) is no less than a &#x201c;culmination of a thousand years of mosque building in Persia . . . the formative traditions, the religious ideals, usage and meanings [and the] ornamentation are all fulfilled and unified in the Masjid-i-Shah, the majesty and splendour of which places it among the world&#x2019;s greatest buildings&#x201d;. This technical and aesthetic peak did not arise in cultural or scientific isolation but emerged alongside, or as a result of, a great culmination of metaphysical writings on light and colour by some of the most important scholars in Islamic and Persian history. Indeed the Safavid era is marked by a coalescence of four prominent Islamic schools of thought that placed light and colour at the core of their writings: the Ishraqi (Illuminist) School of Suhrawardi; the Irfani (gnostic) School of Ibn Arabi; the Peripatetic School of Ibn Sina; and the School of Kalam (theology) of al-Ghazali. In addition, an intellectual edifice which has its basis in the teachings of above schools as well as upon the specific tenets of Shi'ism as found in the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet and Imams reached its completion. A synthesis is created which reflects a millennium of Islamic intellectual life. During the Safavid period, with the artistic and intellectual renaissance that took place, the philosophy of these schools of thought received special attention from such influential figures as Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra. These philosophers, as well as the grand architect of the Masjid-i Shah, Sheikh Baha'i al-Din al-Amili&#x2019;s (henceforth Sheikh Baha&#x2019;i), founded what is now known as &#x2018;The Isfahan School of Philosophy&#x2019;. According to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, this school was patronized by the court of Shah &#x2bf;Abbas, centered in the new Safavid capital of Isfahan, and initiated as part of the wider Safavid cultural renaissance associated with his reign. Speaking about the Safavid use of colour, the Iranian architect Ardalan suggests that the synthesis of philosophy and wisdom proffered by the School of Isfahan &#x2018;&#x2019;provokes an art that seeks to saturate the senses and produces the heralded miniatures of Sultan Muhammad, the Ardabil carpet, the gardens of Fin and the Hasht Bihisht, the Masjid-i Shah and the harmonic synthesis of the Safavid city of Isfahan.&#x201d; Moreover, according to Nasr, the Safavid period provides &#x2018;&#x2019;evident proof of the relationship between Islamic spirituality and intellectuality on the one hand and art on the other&#x2019;&#x2019;, while in other Islamic periods the oral tradition has left no direct written trace to enable this relationship to be studied in detail by historians. Therefore, this work considers how these various philosophies and wisdom traditions, as well as their integration during the Safavid period, help to understand more about the wider intellectual context surrounding the aesthetic experience of colour particularly in relation to the Masjid-i Shah.<br>In order to understand more about how contemporary viewers may have experienced the materials employed in the decoration of the building, this work attempts to the excavate descriptions of coloured materials that would have been experienced similarly to the colourful glazed tilework used in the Masjid-i Shah. Such descriptions are drawn from a variety of sources including travelogues and histories as well as the classical Arabic dictionaries notably the Lisan al Arab (Arab Tongue). Descriptions of buildings and objects are taken from travelogues which include the 11th century writings of Nasir-i Khusraw, those of the 13th century traveller Ibn Jubayr and the 17th century traveller Evliya Celebi. Finally, this category also includes some terms taken from Arabic poetry that describes and evaluates colours on the basis that the language and outlook of the Arab world provided a cultural heritage for the wider Islamic world including that of the Safavids. Attention is also given to writings on colour that address physical and physiological aspects of the experience of colour. Examples of this type of literature include lapidaries by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1274), Kashani (d.1258) and Nishaburi (d.1300) and artistic treatises by Safavid court calligraphers and artists such as Sadiki Beg (d.1610) and Dust Muhammad (d.1565) all of which describe different aspects of either colour mixtures, making paint or painting. This category also includes Ibn al-Haytham&#x2019;s Kitab al-Manazir (his treatise on optics) and the encyclopaedic Rasa&#x2019;il (Epistles) of the Ikhwan al safa (Brethren of Purity) in which they examine visual and aesthetic perception. Yet another type of literature reviewed addresses the experience of colour in relation to knowledge and knowing. Examples of this type of literature can be found in mystical and theosophical treatises by Sufi practitioners such as Najm al-Din Kubra in his Fawatih al-Jamal wa Fawatih al-Jalal (Aromas of Beauty and Preambles of Majesty), Suhrawardi&#x2019;s recital Aql-Surkh (The Red Intellect) as well as Muhammad Karim-Khan Kirmani&#x2019;s Risalat al-Yaqutat al-Hamra (The Book of the Red Hyacinth) all of which are addressed in this research. As part of the wider discussion into the Safavid period with its artistic and intellectual renaissance, comparisons are also made between this principal decorative technique Haft rang employed in the Masjid-i Shah and the wide distribution and celebration of earlier works such as the 12th century poem entitled Haft Paykar (Seven Portraits) by the Persian poet Nizami. This epic poem uses the seven colours of the Haft rang colour system and draws analogies between the application of glazes on tiles and the process of spiritual transformation. Significantly, the poet associates all of this with the Prophet Muhammad's bestowal of colour to the seven planets during his ascension to heaven (Mi&#x2019;raj) following the Night Journey (Isra&#x2019;a). <br>Although the literature referenced above may fall under different disciplines and categories, it is important to point out that the author does not treat them as exclusive of one another. All the primary sources reviewed in this research are understood as part of an interrelated process that documents the premodern Islamic engagement with light and colour. This process is thus related to Berlekamp&#x2019;s suggestion that the premodern Islamic engagement with the world was a &#x201c;coherent symbiosis&#x201d; in which the visual, intellectual and spiritual modes of engagement are conceived as successive steps. Therefore, by the term aesthetics, the author refers not only to sense perception and sensual experience leading to discursive knowledge (judgement, taste, etc.) but also the relationship of these experiences with immaterial or non-corporeal knowledge. For as Valerie Gonzalez observes in her book Beauty and Islam, the premodern understanding of aesthetics was integrative of wider intellectual context that does not assume separateness of the (aesthetic) object of study. Discussing aesthetics in premodern Islamic contexts she posits that it was integrative of various other fields of knowledge. She writes, &#x201c;Aesthetics . . . manifests itself in the dual problem of physical beauty and divine beauty, and sensory perception and inner perception.&#x201d; Consequently, in order to take this expanded understanding of aesthetics into account, an attempt is made here to examine the aesthetic experience of colour by applying the concept of &#x201c;coherent symbiosis&#x201d; which considers the wider intellectual context. Thus, in the same way, this concept is employed as a framework both in relation to its object of study as well as in the way it is studied. As such, this work does not see irreconcilable differences between the various premodern Islamic writings on colour and treats them as situated on different but ultimately connected planes of experience and understanding.<br>In order to interpret and extrapolate on these primary texts, a heavy reliance is made on secondary sources who write on Islamic aesthetics such as Necipo&#x11f;lu, Akkach, Gonzalez and Elias. These scholars are significant to this study principally because their work has dramatically opened up the subject and provided new methodological tools that complement the field&#x2019;s long-standing art historical approach. This work draws on their work both in respect to their findings and methodologies employed which examine classical Islamic thou...</p><h2>Red Hole in Time (Volume 9) (Elma Dill Russell Spencer Series in the West and Southwest)</h2><p>Escalante Canyon is a red-walled hole in a geologic uplift (the Uncompahgre Plateau) in western Colorado.

She moves from one end of the present canyon to the other, "using the clues of what we see as passkeys to the world that was," as well as letters, diaries, and interviews.

Original.</p><p>Peter David is the bestselling author of several previous <i>Star Trek</i>ï¿½ novels, including <i>Star Trek: New Frontier, Q-Squared, Q-In-Law, Vendetta,</i> and, of course, <i>Imzadi.</i> He lives on Long Island.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Riker had no warning before the shock prod tapped him in the small of the back. Immediately he died, temporarily, from the waist down. He hated the occasions when it happened, the feeling of total helplessness. The knowledge that the fall was inevitable was more grueling and hurtful to him than the fall itself. </p><p> He hit the ground hard, as he always did on such occasions. He dropped his ore breaker in the hopes of cushioning some of the fall with his hands, and he was partly successful -- but only partly, as the base of his hands crunched into the hard ground. He felt the jolt all the way up his elbows, and he gasped low in his throat. Then he braced himself for the inevitable kick. It came just as he had expected, a sharp blow to the stomach. In his first days in captivity, that had always been the worst, those stomach blows. Over time, however, he had learned to anticipate them, and he was able to condition himself against them. Just before the impact, he consciously tightened the muscles of his stomach so that a good deal of the impact was blunted. In his fantasies, his gut became so unassailable that his tormentor wound up breaking his ankle. </p><p> It was a very nice fantasy. </p><p> "Get up, Riker," said his captor, and he was kicked again. This time he didn't let out so much as a grunt, and the lack of response on his part seemed to incite his tormentor all the more. "Well?" </p><p> And Riker managed to get out, "Please, sir...I want...some more... </p><p> The guard stared down at him in utter confusion. "All right...if that's your true desire..." He was about to kick Riker a third time, and then a sharp voice stayed the blow. </p><p> "That's enough," it said. </p><p> The Cardassian jailer lowered his foot and turned his attention to the individual who had spoken. The Jailer, whose name was Mudak, was a beefy fellow, but anyone thinking him fat would have been in for a rude shock. Any excess on his frame was pure muscle, and when he moved it was with speed that was blinding. Mudak could be standing two feet away, his hands at his side, and you could suddenly be knocked on your back before you had the slightest awareness that a punch was coming. </p><p> He was also tall, and his eyes were the most striking thing about him. They were dark and pitiless; one would get more sympathy from a black hole than from those eyes. When Riker looked into those eyes, they reminded him of a shark's. They regarded him, and the other prisoners, with an air that clearly indicated that he didn't care whether they lived or died. </p><p> Mudak looked at the individual who had interrupted his sport. It was a Romulan, a head taller than Mudak, with graying hair and a darkly imperious look. In truth, the Romulan had no more status in this place of torment than did Riker. It was as if, in his manner and deportment, he was not interested in acknowledging his relatively low status in the grand scheme of things. From his attitude, it would have been unlikely that any bystander would have realized that Mudak was the jailer and the Romulan the prisoner. </p><p> Yet despite the Cardassian's ostensible authority over the Romulan, Mudak did not seem inclined to press the point. Instead he said, with a level voice that bordered on malevolence, "This is none of your affair, Saket." </p><p> Saket looked from the fallen Riker to Mudak. "It is now, Mudak. And you will leave this human alone." </p><p> "He was moving too slowly," Mudak retorted. "He was daydreaming." </p><p> Saket took a step closer so that he was almost in Mudak's face. "Leave him his dreams, Mudak. In the final analysis, what else have we in this place?" </p><p> Mudak considered this for a moment, and then he laughed low in his throat. It was an eerie noise, as if he were exercising muscles that were nearly atrophied from disuse. In a low voice he rumbled, "Someday, Saket, you will lose your usefulness to my superiors. And on that final day, you will pay for your arrogance." </p><p> "We all pay on the final day, Mudak," Saket said imperturbably. "Jailors and jailed alike; we all pay then." </p><p> Mudak's hands idly twisted on the shaft of the shock prod, as if contemplating shoving it down Saket's throat or into an even more inconvenient bodily orifice. But apparently he thought better of it. Instead he lightly tapped the now-deactivated end of the prod against his forehead in a sardonic salute and moved off. Saket then crouched next to the fallen Riker. "You should be able to feel something in your legs by now. He had the prod on one of the lower settings." </p><p> "I thought as much," grunted Riker. "This time around it was just agonizing instead of incredibly agonizing." </p><p> "You see? Your sense of humor returns already." </p><p> Saket stood, got a firm grip under Riker's arms, and hauled him to his feet. For a moment, Riker felt practically nothing beneath him, and Saket had to move him around bodily to try and get some sense of motion going. "One leg after the other," intoned Saket, "that's it, lad." </p><p> Under Saket's urging, Riker forced himself to move his legs and started to feel growing strength with every step. "Keep going," urged Saket, helping Riker move in a small circle. Within minutes, Riker was walking about in a manner fairly close to his normal strength and stride. "Come, Riker...let us go for a walk. you and I." And with that, the two of them made their slow way across the compound. "Were you out of your mind just before? Saying you wanted more?" </p><p> "It was...it was a quote...from a book, actually...about orphans, <i>Oliver Twist.</i> Author's name was Dickens...I felt it appropriate...since in a way I don't have a mother or father...I'm just sort of...of here..." </p><p> "You're babbling, Riker." </p><p> "No, I'm fine...truly. Dickens...great author...you should read him...<i>Bleak House</i>...story of my life...<i>Tale of Two Cities</i>...about two men who look alike, and one sacrifices himself for the other...never realized when I was reading him as a boy...how much resonance...he'd have for me..." </p><p> "Whatever you say, Riker," Saket said, shaking his head. </p><p> "Saket," Riker said, "we haven't known each other long. But we're friends...you can feel free to call me Thomas. Or Tom, if you prefer." </p><p> "Actually, I prefer Riker," replied Saket. "Always have. Stronger-sounding name. Sounds more pleasingly harsh to the ear." </p><p> "Guess it really doesn't matter," Riker admitted. "As long as you continue to call me 'friend.'" </p><p> They trudged past one of the central deutronium-processing centers, and Tom Riker was impressed -- not for the first time -- over the carefully crafted futility that filled the day-to-day existence in the Cardassian labor camp of Lazon II. </p><p> Tom Riker, the bizarre and perfect duplicate of William Riker who had been created through a strange transporter accident during a rescue operation at a station on Nervala IV. The fact that there had been a second Riker running around had been disconcerting enough to the original item. But after an abortive career in Starfleet, Tom Riker -- taking his new name from his (their) middle name -- had wound up joining the revolutionary group called the Maquis and endeavored to steal the starship <i>Defiant.</i> The result had been his incarceration on Lazon II. </p><p> Lazon II was a fairly desolate world, and the vast majority of it was uninhabitable. One section had been terraformed into someplace where humanoids could survive, and that was the section in which Tom Riker, Saket, and about fifty or sixty-odd enemies of the Cardassian state were currently living out their life sentences. It wasn't that the sentences they had been given were actually called life sentences. There was usually some limit, around twenty or thirty years. Unfortunately, the mortality rate on Lazon II was quite high. Sentencing to Lazon II therefore became a <i>de facto</i> death sentence. </p><p> Lazon II had never actually been intended as a work camp.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Building on biographies by <i>Richard Brookhiser</i> and <i>Willard Sterne Randall</i>, Ron Chernow&#x2019;s <i>Alexander Hamilton</i> provides what may be the most comprehensive modern examination of the often overlooked Founding Father. From the start, Chernow argues that Hamilton&#x2019;s premature death at age 49 left his record to be reinterpreted and even re-written by his more long-lived enemies, among them: Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Monroe. Hamilton&#x2019;s achievements as first Secretary of the Treasury, co-author of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, and member of the Constitutional Convention were clouded after his death by strident claims that he was an arrogant, self-serving monarchist. Chernow delves into the almost 22,000 pages of letters, manuscripts, and articles that make up Hamilton&#x2019;s legacy to reveal a man with a sophisticated intellect, a romantic spirit, and a late-blooming religiosity.<p> One fault of the book, is that Chernow is so convinced of Hamilton&#x2019;s excellence that his narrative sometimes becomes hagiographic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Chernow&#x2019;s account of the infamous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. He describes Hamilton&#x2019;s final hours as pious, while Burr, Jefferson, and Adams achieve an almost cartoonish villainy at the news of Hamilton&#x2019;s passing. </p><p> A defender of the union against New England secession and an opponent of slavery, Hamilton has a special appeal to modern sensibilities. Chernow argues that in contrast to Jefferson and Washington&#x2019;s now outmoded agrarian idealism, Hamilton was "the prophet of the capitalist revolution" and the true forebear of modern America. In his Prologue, he writes: "In all probability, Alexander Hamilton is the foremost figure in American history who never attained the presidency, yet he probably had a much deeper and more lasting impact than many who did." With <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>, this impact can now be more widely appreciated. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Ron Chernow&nbsp;is the&nbsp;prize-winning author of six books and the recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1901. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... CHAP. XIX. Syllogisms being either affirmative or negative, are the attributes of a subject and the subjects of an attribute limited or unlimited in number? Further, can an infinity of middle terms exist between two given extremes? Every syllogism proceeds by means of three terms. The aim of one, the affirmative, class is to shew that C is A, because B is A and C is B; the negative syllogism has as one of its premises the proposition stating that one term is true of another, as its second that one term is not true of another. It is clear then that these premises constitute the principles of demonstration and are what are called its hypotheses. When the premises have been expressed in this form the conclusion must follow; e. g. C is proved to be A by means of B, or again B is proved to be A by means of some other middle term, and similarly C is proved to be B. It is plain therefore that if inferences depend on opinion and are merely dialectical the only thing the logician need keep in view is that the premises of his syllogism should be as generally recognized as possible. Hence if a middle term between A and B really exist, but is thought not to be so, an inference drawn according to the received opinion will be a dialectical inference; but in order to draw universally true inferences one should look to that which really is, not that which is thought to be. Of the former character is a term predicated of other terms essentially not accidentally. By &#39;accidentally&#39; I mean after the manner in which we sometimes say &#39;that white thing is a man,&#39; which is not the same as when we say &#39;the man is white.&#39; In the latter case the man is not white because he is something else, but simply because he is man; in the former proposition whiteness is predicated as an accidental attri...</p><p>Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Fire Bible for Kids Paperback New International Version</h2><p>Here is the first ever study Bible with an emphasis on the Holy Spirit written especially for kids ages 8-12.

With supply routes under attack from the Axis powers and resources scarce, it was Woolton&#x2019;s job to fulfill his promise to the British people&#x2014;and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in particular&#x2014;that there would be food on the shelves each week. Persuading the public to not resort to the black market and to manage on the very limited ration was one thing, but Woolton had to maintain supplies in time of crisis. A grammar school-educated genius, he was a fish out of water in Churchill&#x2019;s cabinet and faced harsh criticism from colleagues, the press, and public.<br> <br> But Woolton used every trick in his entrepreneurial book to secure supplies, and battled to outwit unscrupulous dealers on the streets of cities within the British Empire&#x2014;such as Alexandria in Eygpt&#x2014;persuading customs authorities to turn a blind eye to his import schemes. If Britain had gone hungry the outcome of the war could have been very different. Now, for the first time, readers will find out the real story of how Lord Woolton provided food for Britain and her colonies, discovering that for Woolton, there were indeed days when it was literally a choice of &#x201c;eggs or anarchy.&#x201d;</p><p>William Sitwell is one of Britain&#x2019;s foremost food writers, critics, and broadcasters.

Readers of Edward Hoagland's 1966 classic, <i>Notes from the Century Before</i>, will remember Skook Davidson as the "cranky old man, crippled up with arthritis, cussing into his radio, who gives a report on his wolves instead of his weather, and throws the cork into the creek when he opens a bottle of whiskey so there won't be a way of stopping the fun." In <i>Wild and Free</i> the fun rolls on for 240 pages as author Boudreau falls in with Davidson's long-time protege, Frank Cooke, (now 77) and together they reconstruct the old buzzard's memorable life.<br><br> Davidson came into the remote Kechika valley in northernmost BC as horse packer for the early surveyors, and chose to remain, surrounded only by his own feral horses and the wolves that he found to be congenial enough neighbors. He carved a horse ranch out of some of the world's most isolated wilderness and supplied guiding, packing and entertainment for virtually everyone who ventured into the region for the next forty years. Cooke was the 17-year-old son of a Prince George policeman when he came to the attention of the authorities after he and a couple buddies decided to hang their teacher. "They didn't kill him or anything but they made his face turn black and his tongue stuck out," says Boudreau. "They said he was a far nicer guy after that." Frank's father decided to forestall further such experiments by sending him about as far out in the bush as it was possible to go, apprenticing him to Skook's guiding and outfitting business in the faraway Nechika Valley. Skook had his own ways of handling youthful boisterousness. Once when Frank was roughhousing with one of the other hands, Skook sent them out into the 40-below night to work their steam off on the frozen woodpile. They decided to get back at the old man by stuffing a gunnysack down the chimney and smoking him out, but he caught on and took after them with his shotgun, showering them with birdshot as they dove for cover. When Skook left off, they scuttled back to the woodpile and chopped away half the night before he finally let them come in to thaw out. Frank survived Skook's version of tough love and in time bought half his guide line. He became almost as legendary among the world's outdoorsmen as his mentor, guiding the Prince of Iran, Governor John Connolly of Texas and innumerable other celebrities.</p><p>Jack Boudreau was born in the small community of Penny, BC. He has devoted his professional life to British Columbia&#39;s forest industry working as a licensed scaler, industrial first-aid attendant and forest fire fighter mostly with the Ministry of Forests. From early childhood he has been an avid lover of the outdoors. He is a mountain climber, fisher and skier.

Ritz had been working on Gaye's story for several years before the singer's tragic death, and had conducted a series of extraordinary interviews in which Gaye discussed his deepest secrets. Drawing from these interviews, Gaye's life is recounted in his own words and the words of those who knew him best: his family, friends, and colleagues. What emerges is a full-scale portrait of a charming but tortured artist, a brilliant singer with a divided soul. Here is Marvin's story, from his early years as an abused child in the slums of Washington, D.C., through his rise to the top of the Motown industry, his fall from grace, and his comeback, to his death at the hands of his own father. But it is also the story of his music, and the music of Black America over the past four decades&#x2014;from gospel to doo-wop to soul to funk. The result is an epic tale whose cast of characters includes Diana Ross, Berry Gordy, Smokey Robinson, and Stevie Wonder, among others.The definitive biography of an enormously gifted and sensitive man, <i>Divided Soul</i> takes us deep into the life and music of one of America's most soulful&#x2014;and most troubled&#x2014;singers.</p><p><b>David Ritz</b> is the author of <i>Faith in Time: The Life of Jimmy Scott, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye</i>, and many other books with or about Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and B.B.

He lives in Los Angeles.Based largely on interviews for a projected "autobiography" that was cancelled after Gaye's death in 1984 at the hands of his father, this book is neither especially well-written nor perceptive. PW recommended that the Motown singer's fans "skip the book and listen to his records instead." <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture</h2><p><p><strong>Disco thumps back to life in this pulsating exploration of the culture and politics of the glitterball world.</strong></p> In the 1970s, as the disco tsunami engulfed America, the once-innocent question, &#x201c;Do you wanna dance?&#x201d; became divisive, even explosive. What was it about this much-maligned music that made it such hot stuff? In this incisive history, Alice Echols captures the felt experience of the Disco Years&#x2015;on dance floors both fabulous and tacky, at the movies, in the streets, and beneath the sheets.<br><br> Disco may have presented itself as shallow and disposable&#x2015;the platforms, polyester, and plastic vibe of it all&#x2015;but Echols shows that it was inseparable from the emergence of &#x201c;gay macho,&#x201d; a rising black middle class, and a growing, if equivocal, openness about female sexuality. The disco scene carved out a haven for gay men who reclaimed their sexuality on dance floors where they had once been surveilled and harassed; it thrust black women onto center stage as some of the genre&#x2019;s most prominent stars; and it paved the way for the opening of Studio 54 and the viral popularity of the shoestring-budget <em>Saturday Night Fever</em>, a movie that challenged traditional notions of masculinity, even for heterosexuals.<br><br> As it provides a window onto the cultural milieu of the times, <em>Hot Stuff</em> never loses sight of the era&#x2019;s defining soundtrack, which propelled popular music into new sonic territory, influencing everything from rap and rock to techno and trance. Throughout, Echols spotlights the work of precursors James Brown and Isaac Hayes, dazzling divas Donna Summer and the women of Labelle, and some of disco&#x2019;s lesser known but no less illustrious performers such as Sylvester. After turning the final page of this fascinating account of the music you thought you hated but can&#x2019;t stop dancing to, you can rest assured that you&#x2019;ll never say &#x201c;disco sucks&#x201d; again. 20 photos</p><p>&#x201c;Echols&#x2019;s love of music, her acumen about popular culture, and her gifts as a leading cultural historian come together in this remarkable book. The book is fascinating, carried along by prose that is as sleek and slinky as its subject.&#x201d;&#x2015;Christine Stansell, author of <em>American Moderns</em><br><br> &#x201c;Hot Stuff describes the book as well as its subject: a thoughtful and sophisticated treatment of a significant but much-maligned music.&#x201d;&#x2015;Tim Taylor, professor, Departments of Ethnomusicology and Musicology, UCLA<br><br> &#x201c;Echols aims for&#x2015;and thoroughly achieves&#x2015;a range of higher cultural insights. . . . Using encyclopedic knowledge of the eras&#x2019; biggest stars, she shows how all sorts of musical disco styles played a &#x2018;central role&#x2019; in broadening the contours of &#x2018;blackness, femininity, and male homosexuality&#x2019; in America. . . . Revelatory.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em><br><br> &#x201c;Without question, Alice Echols is one of America&#x2019;s best cultural critics working the beat between popular and academic cultures. With characteristic stylistic verve and scholarly acumen, Echols trolls the edges of our culture&#x2019;s underbelly to discern its central place in politics and economics. In <em>Hot Stuff</em>, she finds disco to be crucial for understanding what happened in 1970s America. Thus invariably, Echols provides a surprising take on familiar scenes by pointing out potholes and pitfalls of late twentieth-century American culture, exploring regions of experience previously overlooked or discounted. Her deep immersion in the subjects of her research, thorough oral histories, and extensive archival investigation flesh out her absolutely original critical insights.&#x201d;&#x2015;Paula Rabinowitz, author of <em>Black &amp; White &amp; Noir</em>Alice Echols is a professor of American studies and history at Rutgers University.

C. Boyle, Mary Gordon, Ann Beattie, Jim Shepard, William Gay, Louis Auchincloss, Kate Walbert, and other notables, from a variety of acclaimed sources. Simultaneous.</p><p>Wonderfully eclectic, <i>The Best American Short Stories 2007</i> collects stories by undeniable talents, both newcomers and favorites. These stories examine the turning points in life when we, as children or parents, siblings or friends or colleagues, must break certain rules in order to remain true to ourselves. In T.C. Boyle's heartbreaking "Balto," a 13-year-old girl provides devastating courtroom testimony in her alcoholic father's trial. Aryn Kyle's charming story "Allegiance" shows a young girl caught between her despairing British mother and motherly American father. In "The Bris," Eileen Pollack brilliantly writes of a son struggling to fulfill his filial obligations, even if this requires a breach of morality and religion. Kate Walbert's stunning "Do Something" portrays one mother's impassioned and revolutionary refusal to accept her son's death. And in Richard Russo's graceful "Horseman," an English professor comes to understand that plagiarism can reveal more about a student than original work. <p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for <i>Best American Short Stories</i> Series Editor Heidi Pitlor</strong> </p><p> Each year's edition of the Best American Short Stories is edited by a prominent guest editor who makes the final selections for the collection--for 2007, it's Stephen King. But working alongside the guest editor is the series editor, who reads thousands and thousands of stories all year long and passes the best on to the guest editor. For years, Katrina Kenison held that one-of-a-kind role for the Best American Short Stories, but in 2007 she handed the reins over to Heidi Pitlor, a former editor at Houghton Mifflin and a novelist in her own right (her debut, <i>The Birthdays</i>, came out in 2006). We asked Pitlor a few questions about what many would consider a dream job. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Congratulations: you now have one of those jobs that must make people say to you, "Oh my goodness, you just sit around reading stories all day! What a life!" Please dispel all relevant myths. </p><p> <strong>Pitlor:</strong> The key is to have young children. I have one-year-old twins, so I have yet to hear the question above. </p><p> I used to imagine Katrina Kenison, the former series editor, swinging in a hammock on a sunny day (there was always a hammock in my mind, and always sunshine), lost in her short stories, the twitter of birds somewhere nearby, a bonbon in her hand. I can assure you that none of the above applies to my day-to-day life--and I'm guessing it didn't apply to hers. Reading this volume of fiction requires intense concentration, large amounts of coffee, total quiet, a babysitter for my kids, and sadly, no bonbons, at least not on a regular basis. Still, I have no complaints. I do love my job and being able to read this much. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Can you explain the process of selecting the best American short stories? What's your relationship as series editor with the year's guest editor (in this case, Stephen King)? </p><p> <strong>Pitlor:</strong> Magazines that publish fiction send copies to me. Literary journals, mainstream magazines, you name it. I probably receive three to four magazines a day. Typically, I read all of this fiction--more specifically, the short stories (no novel excerpts allowed) written by Americans or those who have made the United States their home. I choose 120 that I think are the best, and pass them along to the year's guest editor. </p><p> Stephen King wanted to read along with me, and so he went out and bought tons of magazines himself. We spoke quite often about what we'd read. But typically, I go off on my own for most of the year, pull the stories, and then work with the guest editor at the end of the year to help him or her choose the final twenty for the book. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You're a novelist as well as an editor. How do you read all these different (or depressingly similar) voices every day and keep your own voice strong when you sit down to imagine your own work? </p><p><strong>Pitlor:</strong> Good question! When I'm writing regularly--and I must admit that I need to get back to this--I try to write each day before I begin reading. Again, coffee plays a big role. I get up, take care of the twins for a few hours until the sitter comes, then take typically my third cup of coffee out to my office, which is above my garage. I write first, so that my mind is clear of other writers' voices. I try not to think too much when writing a first draft. For me, thinking sometimes leads to inadvertent stealing. If I'm trying to sort out some sort of puzzle in what I'm writing, it's too easy to remember another writer's approach to a similar one. If I can write a first draft quickly, I'm better off. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In his introduction to this year's collection, King writes that many of this year's submissions felt like "copping-a-feel reading"--stories driven not by a need to be told, but the desire to show off for editors and other writers (rather than regular old readers). Did you have the same reaction? What was your sense of the year's reading? </p><p> <strong>Pitlor:</strong> I'll put it a different way than he did. I often felt that writers put on airs. To me, it's apparent when writers aren't being true to themselves, especially in their writing voice. I want to forget that I'm reading--unless being aware that I'm reading is exactly what the writer is after. But typically, I want to lose myself in the words, to forget that someone is behind them. I want to believe the characters more than that. </p><p> That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of stories that did feel true and urgent, that did take me out of myself for a brief while. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Story writing seems to ride waves of influence, driven at various times by the models, say, of Updike or Barthelme or Carver. Is there a writer now who you feel is the most influential in the stories you read? </p><p> <strong>Pitlor:</strong> Carver still seems to be a big influence--I'm not sure his influence ever waned. Hemingway too, as well as Chekhov, Faulkner, Cheever, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Philip Roth, Alice Munro, Lorrie Moore, Tim O'Brien. No one model comes to mind more than the others at this point. </p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What story was your most exciting discovery of the year? (And did King like it too?) <p> <strong>Pitlor:</strong> There were many for both of us--this is the best part of the job. He and I frequently enthused to each other about this or that new writer. But also about great stories by more familiar writers--that can feel like a discovery too. I don't know, though--naming the most exciting writer feels a bit like admitting you have a favorite child. </p>STEPHEN KING is a prolific and perennially bestselling author and an recognized master of the horror genre.

Raised in the same household and sharing the same wet nurse, Amir and Hassan grow up in different worlds: Amir is the son of a prominent and wealthy man, while Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant, is a Hazara -- a shunned ethnic minority. Their intertwined lives, and their fates, reflect the eventual tragedy of the world around them. When Amir and his father flee the country for a new life in California, Amir thinks that he has escaped his past. And yet he cannot leave the memory of Hassan behind him. <br> <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a novel about friendship and betrayal, and about the price of loyalty. It is about the bonds between fathers and sons, and the power of fathers over sons -- their love, their sacrifices, and their lies. Written against a backdrop of history that has not been told in fiction before, <i>The Kite Runner</i> describes the rich culture and beauty of a land in the process of being destroyed. But through the devastation, Khaled Hosseini offers hope: through the novel's faith in the power of reading and storytelling, and in the possibilities he shows us for redemption.</p><p>In his debut novel, <i>The Kite Runner</i>, Khaled Hosseini accomplishes what very few contemporary novelists are able to do. He manages to provide an educational and eye-opening account of a country's political turmoil--in this case, Afghanistan--while also developing characters whose heartbreaking struggles and emotional triumphs resonate with readers long after the last page has been turned over. And he does this on his first try.<p> <i>The Kite Runner</i> follows the story of Amir, the privileged son of a wealthy businessman in Kabul, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant. As children in the relatively stable Afghanistan of the early 1970s, the boys are inseparable. They spend idyllic days running kites and telling stories of mystical places and powerful warriors until an unspeakable event changes the nature of their relationship forever, and eventually cements their bond in ways neither boy could have ever predicted. Even after Amir and his father flee to America, Amir remains haunted by his cowardly actions and disloyalty. In part, it is these demons and the sometimes impossible quest for forgiveness that bring him back to his war-torn native land after it comes under Taliban rule. ("...I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.")</p><p> Some of the plot's turns and twists may be somewhat implausible, but Hosseini has created characters that seem so real that one almost forgets that <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a novel and not a memoir. At a time when Afghanistan has been thrust into the forefront of America's collective consciousness ("people sipping lattes at Starbucks were talking about the battle for Kunduz"), Hosseini offers an honest, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always heartfelt view of a fascinating land. Perhaps the only true flaw in this extraordinary novel is that it ends all too soon. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>"A wonderful work... This is one of those unforgettable stories that stay with you for years. All the great themes of literature and of life are the fabric of this extraordinary novel: love, honor, guilt, fear redemption...It is so powerful that for a long time everything I read after seemed bland." -- Isabel Allende <br>&nbsp; <br>"Stunning . . . an incisive, perceptive examination of recent Afghan history. . . It is rare that a book is at once so timely and of such high literary quality." -- <i>Publisher's Weekly</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;In <b>The Kite Runner</b>, Khaled Hosseini gives us a vivid and engaging story that reminds us how long his people have been struggling to triumph over the forces of violence -- forces that continue to threaten them even today.&#x201d; -- <i>New York Times</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A haunting morality tale.&#x201d; -- <i>USA Today</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;His passionate story of betrayal and redemption is framed by Afghanistan&#x2019;s tragic recent past . . . Rather than settle for a coming-of-age or travails-of-immigrants story, Hosseini has folded them both into this searing spectacle of hard-won personal salvation. All this, and a rich slice of Afghan culture too: irresistible." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Like <b>Gone with the Wind</b>, this extraordinary first novel locates the personal struggles of everyday people in the terrible sweep of history.&#x201d; -- <i>People</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;To many Western readers, [Afghanistan&#x2019;s] can be an exhausting and bewildering history. But Hosseini extrudes it into an intimate account of family and friendship, betrayal and salvation that requires no atlas or translation to engage and enlighten us.&#x201d; -- <i>Washington Post</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Hosseini does tenderness and terror, California dream and Kabul nightmare with equal aplomb. . .a ripping yarn and ethical parable.&#x201d; -- <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>"A beautiful novel . . . a song in a new key. Hosseini is an exhilaratingly original writer with a gift for irony and a gentle, perceptive heart . . . one of the most lyrical, moving and unexpected novels of the year." -- <i>Denver Post</i></p><h2>Piggies</h2><p>This beloved and bestselling book from Audrey and Don Wood has been delighting children--and sending them off to bed with laughter and sweet dreams--for years. The entertaining antics of ten marvelous pigs in <i>Piggies </i>have made this book a classic. Now here is the new sturdy edition just right for tiny hands, making them a must for every family's board book collection.<br></p><p>Audrey and Don Wood have been writing and illustrating books together for more than twenty years. They live in Santa Barbara, California. <br>PreSchool-K-- In an imaginative play on the fingers-and-toes game, a child's hands introduce two fat, two smart, two tall, two silly, and two wee piggies who cavort on fingertips. Personalities are established early, and children will have fun following a smart reading piggy and a fat eating piggy throughout the book. Belongings such as a teddy bear, balloon, and umbrella can be spotted from page to page, sometimes in out-of-the-way places. Large pages are a perfect backdrop for the antics, which are organized in a series of simple-phrase, double-spread contrasts of hot/cold, clean/dirty, and good--until bedtime when the naughty ones whisk down the tummy, dance on toes, then hide. Time to put them together for fat, smart, tall, silly, and wee goodnight kisses. But one smart piggy is still reading--by flashlight! All of this mischief is done up in oil and begins against a background of warm cream. Then bathing-suited piggies sizzle on bright yellow, snowball against cold blue, bubble up on squeaky-clean pink, squish in mud, behave their best on sky blue, then do their bedtime romp on darkening pages until the final kissing piggies are edged in moonglow. Brilliant colors and large pictures convey the humor to groups, while more subtle details of costume and trappings invite viewers to pore over the antics again and again. "This little piggy . . .

Beyond the unquestioned genius and vision of Bill Gates, what accounts for Microsoft&#39;s astounding success? For the first time, drawing on almost two years of on-site observation at Microsoft headquarters, eminent scientists Michael A. Cusumano and Richard W. Selby reveal many of Microsoft&#39;s innermost secrets. From this inside report based on forty in-depth interviews by authors who had access to confidential documents and project data, Cusumano and Selby identify seven complementary strategies that characterize exactly how Microsoft competes and operates. Bill Gates&#39; &#34;Brain Trust&#34; of talented employees and exceptional management, &#34;bang for the buck&#34; competitive strategies, and clear oranizational goals produce an orientation toward self-critiquing, learning, and improving; a flexible, incremental approach to product development; and a relentless pursuit of future markets. To demonstrate how Microsoft puts these strategies into action, the authors define a further set of principles to reveal a style of leadership, organization, competition and product development which is both consistent with the company&#39;s loosely structured &#34;programmer&#34; culture and remarkably effective for mass-market production of software. Focusing specifically on the unique &#34;synch-and-stabilize&#34; approach to product development, they show how this vital capability enables Microsoft not only to build an increasing variety of complex features and end-products for fast-paced markets with short life cycles, but also to shape evolving mass markets and foster organizational learning. They examine how the flexibility of this process allows the company to &#34;scale up&#34; for larger and more complex projects -- a key asset that Microsoft must continue to cultivate in order to maintain its position as industry leader. Cusumano and Selby&#39;s masterful analysis successfully uncovers the distinctive way in which Microsoft has combined all of the elements necessary to get to the top of an enormously important industry and stay there. Managers in many different industries, especially those concerned with rapidly evolving complex product features and high technical standards, will discover hundreds of invaluable lessons in this superbly readable book.</p><p>This is a &#34;facts ma&#39;am, nothing but the facts&#34; examination of how Microsoft works, both internally, and in the marketplace. Unlike the raft of gossipy Bill-bios or sardonic and shrill pro- or anti-screeds, this book is focused clearly (if sometimes ploddingly) on one central question: the relationship between business strategies and software development. And, as Microsoft becomes increasingly focused on the Internet, it is essential reading not just for software companies, but for all Internet companies as well. Highly Recommended.Michael A.

All was silence within the crumbling stone walls where she had slept.Real sheets, not virtual, were bunched around her legs; she clutched a pillow and watched the faint radiance of dawn swing down from the eastern sky. Around and about her, within the walls and ceiling and floating on every minuscule speck of dust, a thousand other eyes watched. To them she might seem like a figure of porcelain, her mop of fair hair touched only now and then by an errant breeze. So still was she that to those ubiquitous eyes and monitors, she might seem just another fixture of the room.When the rectangle of black from the French doors turned gray, Livia sighed at the ceiling and untangled herself from rest. She walked through the French doors onto the broad stone balcony that encircled the estate's guest apartments. Curled up in one of the old crenels, she looked out over the manicured grounds with their posing topiary and past the indistinct forest tops. Stars still shone, Jupiter on her right, the pastel curves of the Lethe Nebula to her left. It was that time of day when the world seems to pause between breaths--the towering redwood trees that carpeted the hillside were motionless, and all would be silent if not for the chattering of thousands of wakening birds.When the solitude began reminding her of sadder times, she looked out one last time at the empty gardens and then summoned her Society. A hum of voices welled up around her and ghostly figures began appearing above, below, all about; some seemed to stand on the air above the gardens. Each luminous person acknowledged her with a wave, a smile, or a bow. Some were engaged in conversation, some stood alert but motionless. Livia didn't want to talk to any of the real inhabitants of the estate right now, so she excluded them from her sensorium. For now, she was alone with her phantoms.Mother's anima waved from an unlikely perch on one of the window lintels. "Up with the dawn today, Liv?" She laughed. "We have to drag you out of bed back home!"She shrugged. "I need time to review my animas, that's all."Livia strolled back to her bedchamber, hesitating by the dresser. She slept in the nude, and could easily eschew clothing for the day if it proved to be as hot as it was threatening; by default, she would appear dressed to anyone she met. Such informality didn't feel quite right when she was a guest in this house. Livia donned her shift and tuned it to resemble a Tharsis corset and voluminous silk pantaloons as she walked to the bathroom.Conversations bubbled around her as she scowled at the mirror. Some dialogues were happening now in the manor, but most were the peers, laughing and chattering in diverse places back home. Some voices were real people's; some were imitations performed by AIs. They were filtered for relevance by Livia's agents so that she only got the gist of what was happening today: <i>"Devari has a new opera, but he won't show it to anyone. Claims he'll fall out of the manifold if he does!" (Laughter.) "We went flying yesterday. You should have seen Jon! He was practically blue." "What, he'd never been before?"</i><i>"Livia, we all heard about your performance last night. You've finally mastered that Mozart aria, congratulations!"</i><i>"Have you heard? Aaron Varese has vanished!"</i>Livia had been crossing the room to her door. She stopped, looking for whoever had just spoken. It was raven-haired Esther Mannus, one of the most active peers; not the real woman, for she was back home in Barrastea, but rather her anima, which she regularly updated. She was laughing with an indistinct friend--someone not of Livia's Society, but not hostile to it either."Excuse me." The two phantoms swooped into tighter focus, almost becoming real enough to be opaque. Esther covered her smiling mouth with one hand. "Ah, Livia," said the anima. "We thought you'd heard already.""Heard what?""Why, that Aaron has left the city and won't speak to anyone."Livia had worried that something like this would happen. She said, "I'd wondered why he wasn't with me this morning. What's he working on this time?"Esther glanced around, then said quietly, "Something to do with 'science,' whatever that is. He was babbling on about traveling through space last time we spoke." She sighed. "We're used to his provocations. But we also know that whatever he's up to, you're involved."Livia shook her head. "Not this time." She didn't add that she and Aaron had been drifting apart lately. Anyway, it wasn't unheard-of for someone to isolate himself; everybody did now and then, just for sanity's sake. Still, no animas of Aaron had appeared in her Society this morning. Not to leave one behind was definitely an affront and maybe a deliberate insult. It was disturbing.A tiny whistle sounded from the doorway. She saw a flicker of light there, whirling in circles near the latch."Coming," she said. As she went to the door, Livia kept Esther's animabeside her. "I'll go speak to him," she said. "In person. Maybe he has a good explanation for this."Esther nodded. "I won't downgrade his anima until I hear from you, then," she said tartly. Livia nodded and dismissed the phantom.Her two favorite agents were waiting at the door. Since they were not physically real, but rather images painted on her senses by her neural implants, she could make them look like anything she wanted. She'd always had them appear as tiny faeries. The first one, Peaseblossom, said, "You were very busy last night!" in a pipsqueak voice. Cicada muscled Peaseblossom out of the way and proclaimed, "You were all over the place!" And in unison: "We think you're in trouble!""Oh, great," she said. "What did I do?""Jachman and his friends were scheming against Rene," said Peaseblossom, its wings a blur. "They didn't know you have the hots for him.""I do not!""You do. Jachman had your anima open while he was talking to the others, and you challenged him.""To a <i>duel</i>!"Livia groaned and put her hand to her forehead. "I did what?""That's not all!" Cicada puffed out his little chest in pride. "At the selfsame time, you were defending Aaron's honor at a party across town!""The duel," she pressed. "What happened with the duel?" She strolled down the manor's marble steps, following the scent of fresh bacon that was drifting toward her."You fought Jachman, and he killed you," said Peaseblossom. "It's gonna cost you."It certainly would. She was bound to lose some authority over this spat. If she'd been there in person ...She dismissed the idea as wishful thinking. If her anima had fought a duel, then Livia herself almost certainly would have done so had she been there in its place. Animas might only be imitations of people, but they were very accurate imitations."Okay," she said. "I'm going to have to visit that incident. You've got it ready for me?""Any time you say.""After breakfast, then."Cicada made an exaggerated gesture of toeing the ground (he was a meter in the air). "Well, I'm not sure you'll have the time," he said reluctantly."What do you mean?" She stopped and glared at the little man. "What else did I do last night?""You made a date with Lucius Xavier," said Cicada.She gaped at him.Peaseblossom elbowed his companion fiercely. "Not a <i>date</i>," he hissed. "Xavier's not that kind of friend." He cleared his throat and smiled up at Livia. "You agreed to meet him here this morning. In person, that is. You're going hunting Impossibles, remember?""No, I ..." Oh. Was that what his visit had been about?To be strictly polite, Livia should not have had her Society up during last night's soiree. After all, she was a physical guest of the Romanal estate, not just a virtual visitor. She owed her host and hostess her undivided attention at least during supper. Their daughter's confirmation as a true citizen of Westerhaven was important to them and Livia's own family had ties with theirs going back generations.So she had gone through supper and cocktails completely present, and sung her set with her Society absent. Only afterward had she answered the urgent summons of an old family friend, to take a walk in the estate's garden with his virtual self.Now she made herself visible and entered the guest house's kitchens. Here was Lady Romanal, her host, cheerfully flipping eggs on the giant gas stove in the corner. This, the real Lady Romanal, was talking to an anima of Livia herself, while her own anima chatted with another of the guests, Livia's violin player. The violin player was a taciturn man who looked uneasy under the lady's microscope. Livia had never really gotten along with him outside of a professional capacity. She split off an anima to join his side of the conversation and walked to the stove, quickly back-stepping through her other anima's conversation with the lady until she felt prepared.Then she replaced her own image at the lady's side. "Our politics aren't that radical," she said. "Aaron and I simply think Westerhaven's become too complacent. Too ... calm."Lady Romanal sighed. "But is that a real criticism, or just youth speaking? Bacon?""Yes, thank you.""You know what kind of reputation you'll get if you continue this pointless agitation," continued Lady Romanal. She was sweating from the heat, but seemed to enjoy cooking for these, her least important guests. "Your mother is quite concerned.""Concern is Mother's chief talent," said Livia as she held out a plate."Oh, you are a handful!" complained the lady cheerfully. "Is it true you've been advocating that we should all abandon our manifolds and live together?""That was Aaron, not me. He doesn't see why we should deliberately limit our realities.""Delightful!"Livia glowered at her. "He takes his politics very seriously. So do I."Lady Romanal smiled as she piled food on Livia's plate. "Maybe that's your problem. Too serious to be serious, if you catch my meaning." When Livia didn't answer she said, "Perhaps it's time to put the past behind you, Livia."Livia left her anima to continue the conversation and went to sit down. That was a bit rude, but only a bit. Lady Romanal should know what subjects were sensitive to her.As the kitchen filled up with other performers and incidental guests, Livia turned her attention to last night's adventures. She should review that duel, but didn't relish the prospect of watching herself lose. She should also loose some agents to hunt for Aaron. Instead, she back-stepped into her conversation with Lucius."No, there's no emergency," he'd said as she sat down on a bench in the garden next to his virtual self. "But I'd like you here, if you can oblige me."Livia had glanced at the party, decided she was safely alone for the moment, and replaced her own sensorium with the one at Lucius's locale. He too stood outside, but on a wide balcony a hundred meters above the city of Barrastea. The buzz of night bugs was replaced here by the incessant murmur of the city, whose glittering lights spread away to the horizon and reared here and there halfway to the zenith. Livia made the anima she now inhabited move to peck him on the cheek."How are you, Lucius?" she began.He smiled at her in a distracted way. In this light he looked like a slightly shabby, careworn Poseidon, his hair and beard all atangle. "It's been too long since we talked," he said at last."That wouldn't happen if you didn't travel so much." She sat her virtual self down on a stone seat near him."It's my responsibility," he said, frowning into the night. "I sometimes don't like it much. But we're diplomats and ambassadors in Westerhaven, Livia--all of us, whether or not we want to simply stay at home and tend our gardens.""Is that what you want to do?""Sometimes." He brightened a bit. "But not always. Sometimes an adventure beckons. Like tonight. That's why I called you--I wanted a traveling companion for a day-trip, and couldn't think of anybody else who might want to go with me on it.""No? That seems unlikely."At about this point Livia had been interrupted by some members of Romanal's party spilling out into the gardens. She had severed her connection to Lucius, leaving an anima behind, so she didn't know what had happened next.She watched now as Lucius laughed. "You know perfectly well that most people run in tracks. We may be a manifold dedicated to bridging the gaps between other manifolds, but when push comes to shove, nobody you or I know has the courage to travel anywhere really exotic. Not across a real horizon, that's for sure."Livia's anima (which she now observed from outside) looked intrigued, but a little disturbed. "You want to cross a horizon? To where?""I'm not sure. But I'd like you to come with me, if you would."There was a pause. Livia's anima appeared surprised and confused. After a moment it said, "Please tell me that you thought of me because wherever you're going is a musical manifold.""No," he said, looking momentarily guilty. "I know you don't like to be reminded of the accident, Livia, but it did give you a unique perspective that--"Her anima stood up angrily. "Lucius, how could you? I will not travel outside of inscape again for you, or anybody else! Or to any manifold that doesn't use it. You of all people should know ..." She turned away.Lucius reached out to touch her virtual shoulder. "This won't be like that, I swear. I'm not proposing we leave inscape, or any of the manifolds you know. I just want to take a walk along the border of Westerhaven. Tomorrow. And I think you should come."She turned, suspicious. "Why?"He shrugged. "It might improve your authority. Won't hurt mine either. You see, people have been sighting Impossibles near the Romanal estate. It's been going on for several weeks now. So far it's all anecdotal; nobody's inscape has preserved a record. It's as if they're being seen by the eyes only, without the inscape system being aware of them at all."Livia's anima shuddered. The mere idea of inscape having problems made her nervous--would make anyone raised in Westerhaven squirm. No wonder Lucius couldn't find anyone to join him on his little expedition."What are they seeing?" her anima asked, turning back to face him. Livia was a bit surprised that she hadn't turned him down outright; shemight have if she'd been there in person. Then again, she might not. Animas tended to know the personalities of those they modeled better than the people themselves."Mythical creatures," said Lucius. "Bears and wolves that walk like men. Giant birds with masklike faces. They sound like Raven's people. All I want to do is verify that the sightings are genuine and not some kind of hysterical meme. I have no intention of going anywhere near one of the things, believe me.""And you want me along because ...""After the things you've seen, Livia, I think you...</p><h2>A Forever Kind of Family (Those Engaging Garretts!, 7)</h2><p>TWO'S A DATE.

When she was in the studio, she was in charge and in control. When she was with her best friend's orphaned little boy, though, she felt completely helpless.<br><br>She didn't know what to do for him, how to console him&#x2014;or if anything could. She was completely out of her element with the child. When she'd learned that she was now responsible for sixteen-month-old Oliver&#x2014;she'd panicked.<br><br>She didn't know the first thing about caring for a child. She didn't know what to feed him, when to put him to bed or even how to change a diaper.<br><br>Thankfully, she knew how to research, and the internet was overflowing with information&#x2014;including step-by-step video demonstrations of diaper changing. But there was still so much she didn't know, and every free minute she had, she spent reading childcare manuals and psychology textbooks.<br><br>She wouldn't have minded the steep learning curve so much except that her co-guardian&#x2014;Ryan Garrett&#x2014;had stepped into his role with no apparent difficulty, his ease with the child highlighting her own ineptitude. And although Ryan usually dealt with Oliver's middle-of-the-night demands, he didn't seem to be responding tonight.<br><br>She and Ryan had given up their respective apartments and moved into Melissa and Darren Cannon's house so that Oliver would be able to stay in familiar surroundings, but she knew that nothing could ease the loss of his parents.<br><br>She drew in a slow deep breath and pushed her legs over the edge of the mattress, swallowing around the lump in her throat. Her best friend's baby needed so much more than she could give him, but she was trying. Of course, she might be more successful if she could get more than a few hours of uninterrupted sleep in any given night, but so far that hadn't happened.<br><br>Oliver had apparently started sleeping through the night when he was five months old, but he hadn't done so even once since the accident. According to Ryan's mom, who had become their go-to source for all child-related questions, his nighttime waking was neither surprising nor cause for concern. His life and his routines had been disrupted and it was reasonable that he would be upset and confused. Harper's understanding of that didn't make her any less cranky.<br><br>And as the baby continued to cry, his sobs punctuated with heartfelt entreaties for "Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma," she wanted to cry right along with him. Instead she padded across the hall.<br><br>Other than the soft glow of the night-light that emanated from the baby's room, the hall was in complete darkness. She had no concept of time: how long she'd been sleeping or&#x2014;<br><br>The unfinished thought was snatched from her brain along with the air from her lungs when she collided with a wall.<br><br>Not a real wall, but the wall of Ryan Garrett's chest. Solid, strong, naked. And wet.<br><br>His hands, strong and steady, caught her hips as she stumbled backward. She felt the imprint of every finger through the whisper-thin cotton of her boxer-short pajama bottoms, and the heat of his touch made her skin tingle and her pulse race in a way she hadn't experienced in a very long time&#x2014;and definitely didn't want to be experiencing now.<br><br>She sucked in a breath and inhaled the clean, fresh scent of a man just out of the shower. Which explained why he was wet&#x2014;but not why he was wandering around the house half-dressed.<br><br>"I just turned off the shower when I heard Oliver crying," he responded to her unspoken question. "I was trying to get to him before he woke you up."<br><br>"Too late." She winced as the baby's cries hit the next decibel range. "So maybe you could take the time now to put some clothes on?"<br><br>Her tone was sharper than she'd intended, but she didn't apologize for snapping at him. She knew it wasn't his fault that the child's cries had awakened her, but she was half-asleep and his half-naked torso was waking up parts of her that she didn't want awakened, so she wasn't in a mood to be fair.<br><br>"I'm wearing pants," he said, following her into the baby's room. And though it was too dark for her to see the sexy half smile on his face, she could hear it in his voice. "In fact, I put them on just for you."<br><br>As if pajama bottoms sitting low on his hips could be classified as pants.<br><br>The man knew how attractive he was. After all, he was a Garrett, and it wasn't a hardship to look at any one of them. To describe Ryan as tall, dark and handsome would be accurate but completely inadequate. Those complimentary but generic words didn't begin to do him justice. He was at least six-foot-two, because he towered over her own five-six frame even when she was wearing heels. His hair was thick and soft and the color of dark roasted coffee beans; his brows were the same shade, straight and thick over eyes that were probably noted as hazel on his driver's license but were actually mossy green with flecks of golden amber. His jaw was strong and square and often covered with stubble. She didn't usually like the unshaven look that seemed to be in vogue these days but couldn't deny that it suited him, somehow increasing rather than lessening his appeal.<br><br>But Harper had grown up surrounded by beautiful people, so she wasn't readily enamored of a handsome face or an appealing physique&#x2014;and Ryan Garrett had been blessed with both. Far more dangerous, at least to her way of thinking, was the quick mind and easy smile that added to the package. As if that wasn't enough to stack the odds in his favor, he was also friendly and charming and kind. And if her brain had been more awake than asleep, she would have spun on her heel and gone back to her own bed. Instead she followed him into the baby's room.<br><br>She turned on the lamp beside the rocking chair while he went directly to the crib and lifted Oliver into his arms. The baby's heart-wrenching cries immediately ebbed to shuddery sobs as he snuggled against Ryan's strong chest.<br><br>Harper hovered a few feet away, feeling useless and ineffectual as she watched him soothe the distressed child. His voice was low and even, and the sexy timbre was enough to stir the blood in her veins.<br><br>She knew only too well how it would feel to be cradled in his strong embrace, to lay her cheek on his chest and feel the beating of his heart. She knew because she'd spent one incredibly magical night in his arms&#x2014;then the sun had come up, bringing not just morning but the harshness of reality.<br><br>"What's wrong, buddy?" Ryan crooned to Oliver softly. "Are you wet? Hungry?" He patted the baby's bottom. "Yep&#x2014;a diaper change is definitely in order."<br><br>She watched him work, noting how Ryan held Oliver in place on the changing table with one hand splayed on the boy's tummy while he rummaged on the shelf beneath for a clean diaper. He made it look so effortless and easy, while she worked up a sweat trying to prevent the little guy from wriggling off the edge whenever she attempted the task. Which was, admittedly, not nearly as often as Ryan did.<br><br>Over the past two and a half weeks, they'd started to establish a routine. He took care of Oliver in the mornings while she was at work, and when she got home from the studio, he would go into his office for a few hours. They hadn't created a specific schedule for grocery shopping or laundry yet, but Harper was pretty sure that, in the past week, Ryan had done the bulk of those chores, too. She usually started dinner before he got home, and after they finished eating, they worked together to clean up, followed by bath time for the baby. But when it was Oliver's bedtime, he'd made it clear early on that he preferred falling asleep in Harper's arms.<br><br>Ryan glanced over his shoulder at her now as he finished fastening the tabs on the diaper. "Go back to bed, Harper. I've got him."<br><br>Since her alarm would be going off at 4:45 a.m., she wanted to do exactly that. When she'd gone back to work a few days after the funeral, Ryan had offered to be the one to get up in the night with Oliver so that she could sleep through. It wasn't his fault that she heard every sound that emanated from Oliver's room, across the hall from her own.<br><br>Thankfully, she worked behind the scenes at <i>Coffee Time with Caroline,</i> Charisma's most popular morning news show, so the dark circles under her eyes weren't as much a problem as the fog that seemed to have enveloped her brain. And that fog was definitely a problem.<br><br>"Do you want me to get him a drink?" she asked as Ryan zipped up Oliver's sleeper.<br><br>"I can manage," he assured her. "Go get some sleep."<br><br>Just as she decided that she would, Oliver&#x2014;now clean and dry&#x2014;stretched his arms out toward her. "Up."<br><br>Ryan deftly scooped him up in one arm. "I've got you, buddy."<br><br>The little boy shook his head, reaching for Harper. "Up."<br><br>"Harper has to go night-night, just like you," Ryan said.<br><br><i>"Up,"</i> Oliver insisted.<br><br>He looked at her questioningly.<br><br>She shrugged. "I've got breasts."<br><br>She'd spoken automatically, her brain apparently stuck somewhere between asleep and awake, without regard to whom she was addressing or how he might respond.<br><br>Of course, his response was predictably male&#x2014;his gaze dropped to her chest and his lips curved in a slow and sexy smile. "Yeah&#x2014;I'm aware of that."<br><br>Her cheeks burned as her traitorous nipples tightened beneath the thin cotton of her ribbed tank top in response to his perusal, practically begging for his attention. She lifted her arms to reach for the baby, and to cover up her breasts. "I only meant that he prefers a softer chest to snuggle against."<br><br>"Can't blame him for that," Ryan agreed, transferring the little boy to her.<br><br>Oliver immediately dropped his head onto her shoulder and dipped a hand down the front of her top to rest on the slope of her breast.<br><br>"The kid's got some slick moves," Ryan noted.<br><br>Harper felt her cheeks burning again as she moved over to the chair and settled in to rock the baby.<br><br>"It's a comfort thing," she said, not wanting to go into any more detail than that. She knew that it had started when Melissa was trying to wean him and Oliver stubbornly refused to drink from a cup. Her doctor had suggested that he was rejecting the cup because he wanted the skin-on-skin contact of nursing. So Melissa cuddled with him as if she was nursing but gave him milk from a cup.<br><br>After a few weeks, he would happily drink from the cup so long as his hand was on her skin&#x2014;and yes, she confided, that usually meant her breast. But over time, even that had become unnecessary. Losing his mother had obviously rekindled that need for skin-on-skin contact, and Harper had no intention of refusing Oliver the little comfort she could give him.<br><br>"Maybe I need to be comforted, too," Ryan teased.<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "Then maybe you should call Brittney."<br><br>He looked at her blankly. "Who?"<br><br>"The woman you were with the night I called to tell you about Melissa and Darren's accident," she prompted.<br><br>The confusion in his eyes cleared. "That was Bethany."<br><br>"I'm going to have to write down the names of all of your girlfriends in order to keep them straight."<br><br>"That won't be necessary," he said. "Because there's no reason for you to cross paths with any of them."<br><br>"Fair enough," she agreed. "So long as you're back from whatever bed you tangle the sheets in by five thirty so that I can go to work, I don't care where you sleep."<br><br>"That's what time you leave every morning? Five thirty a.m.?"<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>Because Oliver had been waking so frequently in the night, Ryan usually slept like the dead after he got the baby settled back down and returned to his own bed. So while he knew Harper's day started early, he hadn't realized it was quite so early. "That's insane."<br><br>"Look on the plus side," she suggested. "It will save you those awkward morning-after goodbyes."<br><br>She'd made it clear from their first meeting that she didn't hold the highest opinion of him. Even at twenty-one, not yet graduated from NYU, Harper Ross had been a woman with plans and ambitions. Ryan had been finishing up his business degree at Columbia and preparing for an entry-level position at Garrett Furniture. And although there had been some definite chemistry between them, she'd made it clear that she wanted more than a man content to work in sales.<br><br>Even when she'd found out that his family owned the multimillion-dollar company, she hadn't been impressed. In fact, she'd accused him of coasting through life on his family name and money. There was probably some truth to that, but Ryan had grown up with a workaholic father who missed more family dinners than he attended. As a result, he'd vowed not to live his life the same way and he refused to apologize for the fact.<br><br>He also refused to let her put him on the defensive about his personal relationships.<br><br>"The only awkward morning-after I ever experienced was with you," he told her.<br><br>Harper drew in a sharp breath and glared at him over the baby's head. "We agreed to <i>never</i> talk about that night."<br><br>"I didn't agree to any such thing," he denied. "You decreed it and I chose to go along."<br><br>She glanced down at Oliver, who, despite their heated exchange, had immediately settled back to sleep. "So why are you bringing it up now?" she challenged.<br><br>It was a good question&#x2014;and one he wasn't sure he knew how to answer. Because even if he hadn't explicitly agreed that the subject was off-limits, he <i>had</i> gone along with her request that they both forget it had ever happened.<br><br>Except that he'd never really forgotten about that night. Yes, he wanted to&#x2014;because it was more than a little humbling to share an incredible sexual experience with a woman who made it clear that it was never going to happen again&#x2014;but his efforts had been unsuccessful.<br><br>No, he hadn't forgotten about that night, but he'd pretended that he could. And he'd never said a word about it to anyone. Until now.<br><br>"Because it's there," he finally said in response to her question. "Even if we don't talk about it&#x2014;it's there."<br><br>"It was one night more than four years ago," she reminded him. "Ancient history."<br><br>"If it was so long ago and so unimportant, why didn't you ever tell Melissa about it?" he challenged.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"You always said that there were no secrets between best friends, that you told her everything. So why did you never tell her about that night?"<br><br>"Because I didn't want things to be awkward between us."<br><br>"Us <i>who?</i> You and her? You and me?"<br><br>"All of us." She kept her focus on the baby. "If I'd told Melissa, she would have told Darren. Then anytime we were all together, it would have been awkward and weird."<br><br>"You don't think it was awkward and weird anyway?"<br><br>"Not at all," she denied.<br><br>"You don't feel <i>any</i> residual attraction when we're together?"<br><br>"Hardly."<br><br>His gaze narrowed at the dismissive tone, but he noticed that she didn't look at him as she spoke. Her gaze had dropped to his shoulders, skimmed down his torso. Even in the dim light, he could tell that she was checking him out&#x2014;and appreciating what she saw. "You're a smart woman, Harper."<br><br>She dragged her eyes from his bare chest to meet his again. "Thank you," she said, just a little waril...</p><h2>The Fall of Shanghai: The splendor and squalor of the imperial city of trade, and the 1949 revolution that swept an era away</h2><p>From the Dust Jacket: &#34;The takeover, when it came, was quick, as expected.

He is the author of seven books and numerous articles.'To this day, reading good narrative history is a never-failing pleasure. History, that is, like Robert Bruce Mullin's A Short World History of Christianity. It is no easy business, getting two millennia of Christian history into 283 readable pages. But Professor Mullin has done the job, in a readable style that makes the fruits of his impressive ample scholarship available to a general audience.' --George Weigel, Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center<br><br>This book should be welcomed by all who value clear writing, careful scholarship, succinct reporting, and carefully weighed judgments. If measured by standards of comprehensiveness or of answering every question in the long history of Christianity correctly, this book, like all others, must fail. But if measured by its success at portraying that history from below as well as from above, providing significant treatment of the Southern hemisphere along with the West, and incorporating the stories of many denominational families in a single account, then this book must be judged a resounding success. --Mark A. Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor, History Department, University of Notre Dame<br><br>This readable history reflects the sure instincts of a master teacher. Bruce Mullin s text integrates the theological and social dimensions of Christian history, providing readers with a masterful guide to the subject for many years to come. --Dana L.

It was one large room with wooden floors, high ceilings, and a big old window that faced the morning sun. We bought a table for thirty dollars from a thrift store down the street and carried it over our heads on the walk home. We slept on a blow-up mattress on the floor. Below us, there was a French restaurant and a wine shop with a five-dollar discount table. We could walk to the two-screen theater, Izzy&#x2019;s Coffee Den, and Malaprop&#x2019;s Bookstore. Two tuba players, brothers simultaneously divorced by their wives, owned the loft across the hall; when they came up on weekends, we sat on their window ledge and drank single-malt scotch.<br>Luke worked an office job selling billboards. He woke up at seven, took a shower, and kissed me on the forehead as I slid deeper under the sheets. I woke up around nine and sat down at the desk Luke and I made together. I was on a writing grant to finish my first book. I had all the time in the world, all day long. I spent the mornings thinking. I tried to focus on my first-grade teacher, who told my mother on Parent-Teacher Conference Day, &#x201c;Whatever you do, keep her away from sports.... She has the soul of an artist.&#x201d; We thought that teacher was an idiot for a long time. Now I hoped she wasn&#x2019;t.<br>At night we played in the parking lot of the social services building. Luke could only score by hitting the silver pole of the light post. I could score between the white lines of a parking space. We tried tricks. Luke did rainbows, shin juggles, snazzy things you see on YouTube videos. One side of the parking lot was bookended by a large mural painted by kids. We banged the ball off pastel handprints, trees, and outlined clouds. Bums occasionally stopped to watch, dangling their arms over the wall and whistling. When one of us kicked it over the wall, they didn&#x2019;t retrieve it for us; instead they watched as we sprinted to catch the ball that rolled faster and faster down the sloping street.<br>After our game was over, we sat along the curb, tired, nostalgic. Luke had been a Notre Dame center midfielder who scored big goals in big games. I&#x2019;d been the youngest Division I athlete in NCAA history, a starter and leading scorer for Duke at sixteen. Now we made jokes about being twenty-four-year-old has-beens.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>DURING THE DAY there was too much time. I tried to kill the hours: I read books, great books, but I felt guilty just laying there reading page after page while the rest of the world complained about a lack of time.<br>The writing wasn&#x2019;t going well. My book was about my brother, and the effect one kid has on the other, but it was hard to squeeze our lives into pages. He has a way of saying things that land&#x2014;like the time after the hurricane, when twenty-two trees fell down in our backyard, and he said, &#x201c;Damn, sis, looks like somebody used the sun as a wrecking ball.&#x201d; Or the time he described prison as &#x201c;a lot like middle school, people trying to be cool.&#x201d; The story was important to me and I wanted to say it right. I spent all day sitting there, running my hand along the wood of the desk. Luke and I didn&#x2019;t know how to make a desk: we&#x2019;d nailed down four planks of raw wood atop four skinny logs we&#x2019;d found laying alongside a vacant lot. The wood was starting to warp and the trunks were splintering, but I loved that desk.<br>I kept a short stack of books on the left corner&#x2014;my current favorites, books I could pick up and flip open, reading sentences and voices I hoped would influence my own. One of them was a planner my best friend, Leah, gave me when we were fourteen; in it there was a photograph and a quote from a famous author every month, and even though the dates were all wrong, I still read the quotes and stared at the photos.<br>On the tenth month of my yearlong writing grant, I was sitting at the desk once again looking through the planner. I thumbed past June, July, and August until I reached the black-and-white photo of Truman Capote and stared into his round eyes. Right beneath his portrait there were these words: &#x201c;The test of whether or not a writer has divined the natural shape of his story is just this: After reading it, can you imagine it differently, or does it silence your imagination and seem to you absolute and final? As an orange is final. As an orange is something nature has made just right.&#x201d; When I sat and read my 240-page draft, I knew it wasn&#x2019;t an orange, and I had no idea how to make it one.<br>I lay down on our fake-suede couch and thought about my dad, who for the last several months had said things like, &#x201c;You should join the FBI&#x2014;fantastic benefits.&#x201d; He was worried because I had no health insurance. I told him I&#x2019;d be the world&#x2019;s worst spy, but he took that as evidence I&#x2019;d be a good one: &#x201c;See, no one would ever guess.&#x201d; I started taking suggestions like this into consideration. I entertained the possibility of anything&#x2014;law school, business school&#x2014;things I&#x2019;d ruled out from the very beginning. Suddenly I wondered about wearing pencil skirts and high heels, carrying a briefcase and spreading papers across a long conference table. Anything but writing.<br>Because of a large hole in our Camry&#x2019;s muffler, I could hear Luke get home from work. I&#x2019;d pull on the chain that angled our window up and wave to him, grateful that my time to write was up. Watching him walk across the parking lot, wearing button-downs, tan slacks, and brown dress shoes, it looked like he was playing grown-up. He had wild blond curls that he wore in a big fro in college (opposing teams called him Brillo Pad), but now he had me cut the curls off so that he&#x2019;d look &#x201c;professional.&#x201d;<br>In the beginning he enjoyed having a pattern&#x2014;brewing coffee and ironing down the collar of his shirt in the mornings. He liked trying on a profession. During his job interview, he&#x2019;d taken an aptitude test. He lied through most of it, picking whatever answer he thought a true salesman would pick. If the question asked, &#x201c;At a party, would you be in the center of the crowd or along the wall?&#x201d; he of course said he&#x2019;d be the guy in the center. Then when he failed the test and the results said he&#x2019;d make a terrible salesman, he didn&#x2019;t know what to make of it. As they debated whether or not to hire him, he thought about telling them he lied, but that admission seemed worse than just failing. They ended up hiring him, and he was left to wonder in private what the test would have said if he&#x2019;d answered honestly. <i>Maybe,</i> he thought, <i>I&#x2019;m meant for sales</i>.<br>Six months in, one of the maintenance guys quit, so they started sending Luke&#x2014;the most limber guy with a desk job&#x2014;up to repair the billboards. He did not like going up there. He wouldn&#x2019;t admit he was unhappy, but I could tell from the way he curled up on the bed when the alarm went off, his whole body sweating. I guess up there, 150 feet above the highway, standing on a see-through iron grate, wind howling, vinyls flapping, he came to two realizations: one, he didn&#x2019;t like being up on billboards, and two, he didn&#x2019;t like selling billboards. His plan was to make it through the end of the year. After that, he didn&#x2019;t know. Neither of us did.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>ON A SUNDAY afternoon, I drove to Durham to watch ninety minutes of my old life. I sat on the far side of the bleachers, away from everyone else. It embarrassed me to come back. I felt like the loser who graduates from high school but still hangs around the benches in the mornings before school.<br>I came primarily to watch Rebekah Fergusson, a freshman on the team when I was senior. In college, I&#x2019;d made a twenty-minute documentary centered on identity through sports. Ferg was one of four characters. While the other three were standouts on the field who said things like, &#x201c;I would do anything to win,&#x201d; she was the bench-warming counterpart who said, &#x201c;You think you&#x2019;ll get here and run sprints and work hard and then one day you&#x2019;ll play and then one day you&#x2019;ll start&#x2014;you know, Rudy and all that crap&#x2014;but, well, it&#x2019;s not always that easy.&#x201d; When a professor watched footage of her green puppy-dog eyes looking earnestly at the camera, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost like you can see it&#x2014;she&#x2019;s too nice to be good.&#x201d; But that Sunday she got her first start against Florida State, and in the rain, in the mess, she was playing with the effort of someone who&#x2019;d spent three years pent up on the bench: she beat the FSU forward to the ball, stripped it off her when she tried to dribble, and won everything in the air. &#x201c;That kid&#x2019;s playing her heart out,&#x201d; a gravelly voice said from behind me, mostly to himself. The man had bushy white hair and chewed on a cigar as he paced back and forth in the aisle. Most likely he was somebody&#x2019;s dad: dads always sought space by themselves, never wanting to risk anyone trying to engage them in conversation while they were trying to watch.<br>&#x201c;Playing your heart out&#x201d;&#x2014;when I was a kid, it was my favorite expression. Even now, guiltily, I love it. &#x201c;Heart&#x201d; lost its power as we got older; too many coaches said it in too many pregame speeches. You stopped really hearing them. But you still knew what it meant when it happened, when nothing could touch you. It was the main thing I missed.<br>When my senior season ended, they handed us plaques that showed our span: 2000&#x2013;2004. One of the underclassmen said, &#x201c;It looks like you guys died.&#x201d; I would have tried out for the women&#x2019;s professional league, but it folded the year I graduated. Your whole life you&#x2019;re a soccer player, then suddenly you&#x2019;re not.<br>So I applied for graduate school in creative w...</p><h2>The Books of Magic: Death After Death - Book 7</h2><p>Tim Hunter finally comes to a decision about his powers.</p><p></p><h2>A Curator&#39;s Quest: Building the Museum of Modern Art&#39;s Painting and Sculpture Collection, 1967-1988</h2><p>He was extraordinarily successful at acquiring for the collection such monuments of modern art as Pollock&#39;s One: Number 31, 1950 and Picasso&#39;s 1914 sheet-metal Guitar. The exhibitions he mounted as Chief Curator and later Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum--among them the unprecedented Pablo Picasso: A Retrospective--set a standard of curatorial excellence. A Curator&#39;s Quest is the story of the professional life of a pioneering curator who built the Modern&#39;s unparalleled collection, and a history of MoMA itself during that key period. For anyone interested in the history and world of modern art, in connoisseurship and collecting, and in art scholarship in general, A Curator&#39;s Quest is at once an indispensable addition to the history of modern art and a testament to William Rubin&#39;s life and achievements--is truly a publishing event.</p><p>William Rubin (1927-2006) taught at Sarah Lawrence College and NYU before joining MoMA in 1976 as curator. He was director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture from 1973- 1988, an editor for Art International, and a collector of contemporary art including works by the Abstract Impressionists and Frank Stella. His major exhibitions for MoMA include &#39;Picasso: A Retrospective&#39; (1980), &#39;Primitivism in 20th Century Art&#39; (1984), and &#39;Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism&#39; (1989).Here we see Rubin as a lustful, vigilant hunter with a keen eye, a diplomat who brokered art deals with Russia during the Cold War, and a consummate businessman who instigated the advantageous though controversial process of taking sealed bids from dealers when selling works of art. Interwoven with detailed stories of how, for how much and from whom Rubin acquired artworks are his personal tastes, honest opinions and passionate descriptions. * Bloomberg News * This major monument to a groundbreaking curator provides evidence of how Rubin&#39;s vision shapes our view of modern art. * Library Journal *</p><h2>Modern Classics Mersey Sound (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>&#39;I wanted your soft verges But you gave me the hard shoulder&#39; The Mersey Sound brought poetry down from the shelf and on to the street, capturing the mood of the Sixties and speaking to real lives with its irreverent, wry, freewheeling verses of young love, petrol-pump attendants, CND leaflets and bus journey capers.

What will we do? Who will we see?<br>ï¿½ How can I become more excited about heaven as my true home? <br>ï¿½ Is it possible that knowing more about heaven will result in greater joy and purpose in my daily life?<br><br>It's not easy separating fact from fiction when it comes to heaven, nor is it always easy to see how the afterlife can affect our lives today. After a car accident caused his nineteen-year-old son to unexpectedly enter heaven, Pastor Steve Berger chose to reject despair and commit himself to carefully studying his son's new, eternal home. He had no idea how much there was to learn, and his life hasn't been the same since. This biblical and deeply personal study of heaven will give you hope for the future. <br><br>But more than that, it will show you what it means to live <i>today</i> in light of the reality of heaven. If your view of heaven isn't life-changing, it needs to be adjusted. Let Pastor Berger's exploration of eternity fill you with overflowing hope, courage, and purpose. <br><br>"Sometimes we feel stuck--stuck between the hope of heaven and the pain of this world. In <i>Between Heaven and Earth</i>, my friend Steve Berger shows us how to not only live in that tension, but how--and why--we should embrace it."--Dave Ramsey, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio show host<br><br>"I grew up hearing people say, 'Some Christians are so heavenly minded they are of no earthly good.' Nowadays it seems like the church has become so earthly minded we're of no heavenly good. In <i>Between Heaven and Earth,</i> my friend Pastor Steve Berger shows us the absolute necessity of having a heavenly mind-set (Colossians 3:1-2) in order to make a real difference in people's lives while we remain on earth. Embrace the truths of this book--learn how to have your heart in heaven and your hand in the harvest. It's one decision you'll never regret!"--Jeremy Camp<br><br>"When my friend Steve Berger talks about heaven, I sit up and listen. I've walked with Steve as he's faced the trials of this life, and I've observed how he has emerged with a deeper faith and love for the Father and the people around him. What he has taught me makes me long for heaven. It also makes me want to spend my time on earth making a difference . . . and finishing well."--Michael W. Smith<br><br>"A beloved pastor and teacher, Steve Berger taught for years on the reality of heaven even as we serve Christ on earth, never knowing that one tragic event would bring both realities irrevocably into sharp focus in a moment. . . . Some of God's greatest mysteries are wrapped up in tragedy, but the tear-stained wisdom mined in that darkness is a gift to us all. In this marvelous book, heaven will become a greater reality even as we are invited to live our lives on earth with greater passion."--Sheila Walsh, author of <i>The Storm Inside</i><br><i><br></i>"Steve has a rich, compelling perspective on Glory that will give you fresh grace to lean into the perfect love of Jesus <i>today</i>. Therefore, I encourage readers not to stop at just one--instead buy a whole case of these puppies and pass them out to all your friends and family!"--Lisa Harper, author, Bible teacher and Women of Faith speaker<i> <br><br></i>"In stark contrast to the Bible--and the whole of Christian history--today's believers think little about heaven and much about the comforts, challenges, and distractions of this life. In this much-needed corrective, Pastor Steve Berger challenges and equips us to be more heavenly minded, so we can, in fact, be more earthly good."--Michael Hyatt, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authorSteve Berger is the senior pastor to more than four thousand people at Grace Chapel, Leipers Fork, Tennessee.

With his devil-may-care attitude and cavalier approach to living, Hunt endeared himself to the British motor racing public, driving for Lord Hesketh&#39;s Formula One team and later, in 1976, for McLaren during his World Championship-winning season. But alongside the triumphant moments came the inevitable darker side - the drugs, the alcohol and the women. The book reveals the truth about his playboy image, and explains Hunt&#39;s successful transition from hero of the track and social celebrity to articulate BBC television commentator, breeder of budgies and energetic cyclist. These are the memoirs that Hunt had always planned to write with author Gerald Donaldson before his sudden death of a heart attack, aged 45. This is the official biography, written with the full approval of the family estate.</p><p>Gerald Donaldson is one of the world&#39;s most highly regarded motor sport authors.

In <i>Sustaining the Cherokee Family</i>, Rose Stremlau illuminates the impact of this policy on the Cherokee Nation, particularly within individual families and communities in modern-day northeastern Oklahoma. <br><br>Emphasizing Cherokee agency, Stremlau reveals that Cherokee families' organization, cultural values, and social and economic practices allowed them to adapt to private land ownership by incorporating elements of the new system into existing domestic and community-based economies. Drawing on evidence from a range of sources, including Cherokee and United States censuses, federal and tribal records, local newspapers, maps, county probate records, family histories, and contemporary oral histories, Stremlau demonstrates that Cherokee management of land perpetuated the values and behaviors associated with their sense of kinship, therefore uniting extended families. And, although the loss of access to land and communal resources slowly impoverished the region, it reinforced the Cherokees' interdependence. Stremlau argues that the persistence of extended family bonds allowed indigenous communities to retain a collective focus and resist aspects of federal assimilation policy during a period of great social upheaval.<br><br></p><p>"The level of in-depth detail Stremlau provides on each family is amazing. . . .

In the country s earliest years, it carried the tide of settlement westward. During the Civil War, both Union and Confederate troops marched along it. In the years before World War I, it became a link in a great transcontinental roadway. When numbered highways were introduced, it was designated U.S. 60. Today, there s history waiting around every bend of its 180 miles. The trail enters West Virginia from Virginia just a stone s throw from White Sulphur Springs, then winds its way through just about every era of West Virginia history before it reaches the little town of Kenova, where it crosses the Big Sandy River and heads into Kentucky. This book is the next best thing to getting in the family car and setting out to personally explore the Midland Trail. If you re fortunate enough to make such a trip, you can use it as handy guide so you don t miss anything along the way. If you can t travel the trail in person, these vintage picture postcards and other historic images provide an armchair visit that takes you over mountains, along rivers, through lush valleys and into small towns. Here s White Sulphur Springs and its world-famous Greenbrier Resort; Lewisburg, home of the General Lewis Inn and the other Carnegie Hall; Malden, where Booker T. Washington spent his boyhood; Gauley Bridge, a town that changed hands numerous times during the Civil War, and Cedar Grove, the oldest settled community in the Kanawha Valley. You can pay a visit in these pages to Hawk s Nest, with its breathtaking views of the New River; Babcock State Park, where the Glade Creek Grist Mill may be the most photographed subject in West Virginia, and the Glenn Ferris Inn, which has been welcoming travelers since 1839. The Midland Trail connects West Virginia s two largest cities, Charleston and Huntington, and both offer history-lovers much to see and enjoy either in person or in the pages of this unique pictorial history. History beckons... Along West Virginia s Midland Trail.</p><p>A veteran newspaperman and the author of a number of books on local and regional history, James E.

But of all the sheriffs of the frontier, one man stands out as a true hero: Bass Reeves.<br><br>He was the most successful Federal Marshal in the US in his day. True to the mythical code of the West, he never drew his gun first. He brought hundreds of fugitives to justice, was shot at countless times, and never hit. <br><br>Bass Reeves was a black man, born into slavery.

He'd seen horns that size cut men and kill horses, so he waited. She was about to go into labor, what he called getting calf sick, and when she was actually having the calf she couldn't attack him. Then he would run up, drop a noose around her head and dance back before one of those horns could catch him. The rope was twenty feet long and tied to a four-foot piece of log about five inches in diameter. When the cow tried to run, the log would tangle in the mesquite and rocks and stop her so she could be captured, branded and added to the mister's herd to sell and make him rich.<br><br> The cow moved and he studied her with a knowing eye. She was huge for a cow, with flat sides and many scars from running through brush and fighting other cows.<br><br> It would be another half hour, at least, before labor. She wasn't even hunched yet.<br><br> "You take the rope and the log," the mister had told him. The boy never thought of him as the master, though legally he was, like all white men who owned slaves. The boy's mammy had told him: "Your name is Bass, and ain't no man your master. Not now. Not ever. We got to do what we got to do 'cause of the white man's law. But that don't make no man your master in God's eyes."<br><br> Bass studied the horns. They came around so fast, and sharp, sometimes you almost couldn't see them move. Once he moved in too close on an old brindle cow and just the tip of a horn caught his trousers. Cut them open like a knife.<br><br> "Zzzzzttt!" The cloth almost sang. They were no-'count pants anyway, handed down from the mister, all patches and held up with a piece of tow over his shoulder. He knew his mammy would sew them up, but he didn't like the feel of the horn swinging by that close.<br><br> Another inch and I'd have been looking at my guts, he thought, squinting in the sun. Pulled out on a horn like wet rope. He'd seen cow and pig guts when they slaughtered, horse guts once when a bull hooked a mare that wasn't paying attention. He did not want to see his own.<br><br> Now he heard movement in the mesquite off to the right and waited. Might be the mister sneaking to see if he was working. Make sure he was doing.<br><br> No need at all, he thought. I work all the time. Not for the mister. I work because it makes the time pass.<br><br> It was two coyotes, low on their bellies. They knew there would soon be afterbirth for them to eat.<br><br> Bass watched them. They did not know he was there, back in the shady hole where he'd had to scare out a rattlesnake. The snake had buzzed some and then left when he pushed it with a stick. He didn't like snakes. He wasn't afraid of them-how could you be scared of something that couldn't crawl faster than a slow walk?-but they were always mad. Seems like they bit just to be mean. His mammy told him of one that crawled in a cradle and bit a baby and killed it. Why? Baby wasn't doing a thing. Sometimes Bass killed snakes, especially around the house where they could get a dog or cat or baby pig or a chicken. But when he was out in the mesquite or down at the creek bottom, he let them be. If, he thought, they let me be. He didn't like killing things without a good reason.<br><br> The mister, now, would take his percussion pistol and shoot anything. Lizards off a rock, songbirds off a rail. Or try to. Whenever he got hold of a whiskey jug, he couldn't hit the ground, let alone a bird on a fence.<br><br> Now, it was something, how the coyotes knew when a cow was ready. Maybe the smell, Bass thought, or they might be witch dogs. His mammy told him that, back in New Orleans where she was from, there were witch dogs that could tell you things if you knew how to understand them. She didn't know how to talk to the dogs but her mammy could do it, could give a witch dog molasses, and when it wrinkled its lips to lick the molasses off its tongue, she could tell if someone was going to die or when they would have a baby, and was it a boy or a girl.<br><br> "Mammy said the power skips," Bass's mammy told him. "Didn't come to me, but maybe to you, to read the witch dogs. Mostly women have it, but I didn't have a girl and won't be no more chirrun. So if it happens, it will have to be you."<br><br> Bass was seven when his mammy told him that, better than three years ago come fall. He had lifted a jug of blackstrap molasses from the pump house and tried it on one of the mister's old tick hounds. He tried it so often the dog took a liking to it and followed him around all day, waiting to have his tongue wiped with molasses.<br><br> Problem was, Bass remembered now as he watched the coyotes move toward the cow, problem was it gave the hound the black skoots. Dog messed the yard and the pump house and all over the porch, and Bass had to quit because the mister said he was going to shoot the hound if he didn't stop messing.<br><br> Bass never learned anything from the hound but that it liked molasses and had a straight pipe for a gut. It was a good dog and Bass felt bad when one day a snake cooling itself by the pump house bit it between the eyes. Killed that hound. After that, whenever Bass saw a snake in the yard, he would get a hoe and chop it and feed it to the pigs.<br><br> There. The cow hunched. Her labor was starting. Bass gathered the rope and the log. The coyotes saw him and one looked straight into Bass's eyes and moved its lips.<br><br> At first he couldn't believe what he saw. The coyotes were thirty-five yards away, just past the head of the cow, but when Bass shook his head, the coyote was still looking at him, straight up into his eyes. And the animal's lips moved.<br><br> Things will change.<br><br> Bass wasn't sure if he heard it or felt it like a touch on his skin, but the phrase was there. In his head. As clear as if somebody had said it aloud. And it came from the coyote.<br><br> Things will change.<br><br> "What will change?"<br><br> He said it so loud that the coyotes both jumped and the cow started and turned to see him for the first time, though she didn't move, couldn't move now that her labor had begun.<br><br> The coyotes didn't answer him, either aloud or in his head, but they didn't run. Instead they stood, one looking at the cow, the other staring directly at Bass.<br><br> "Are you a witch dog?" Bass said.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Leaders in Homoeopathic Therapeutics with Grouping and Classification</h2><p>Purchase of this book includes free trial access to million-books.com where you can read more than a million books for free.

Among the symptoms called characteristic, as given by Constantine Hering, are these : " After aromatics in food or as medicine, particularly ginger, pepper, etc., and after almost any kind of so-called " hot " medicines (Goullon)." Also, " will also benefit persons who have been drugged by mixtures, bitters, herbs and so-called vegetable pills, etc.&#x2014;(B.)." This is putting it in too wholesale a fashion. It would be true if said that Nux vomica will often benefit such cases. The fact is that it will benefit those cases in which the use of such drugs, aromatics, pills, etc., has brought about a condition that simulates the symptoms produced in the provings of Nux vomica, or in cases to which it is homoeopathic, and no others. Another fact is that these things often do produce such a condition, and that is one reason why so many physicians are almost invariably prescribing Nux vomica the first thing, in cases coming from allopathic hands, without even examining the case. But it is unscientific. We have a law of cure, and there are cases in which the Nux vomica condition is not present but another more similar remedy must be given. It doesnot alter the case to say, " Well, I did not know what had been given," for Nux vomica will neither antidote the effects of the drug poison nor cure the disease condition unless it is homoeopathically indicated, especially if given in the dynamic form. Here are two more of Hering's card symptoms, in which are given the temperaments that are most susceptible to the action of Nux : " Over-sensitiveness, every harmless word offends, every little noise frightens, anxious and beside themselves, they cannot bear the least, even suitable medicines.(B.)."

The family relocated to England in 1886. Joyce enjoyed drawing lessons throughout her schooling, which was often interrupted due to financial problems, and later enrolled at Exeter Art School.<br>She worked as a Voluntary Aid Detachment after passing her Red Cross exams. Joyce designed a recruitment poster to encourage women to join up. <br>She married a young doctor, in 1919 and moved to New South Wales. Joyce's work was constantly in print and exhibited in many galleries.<br>In 1922, Joyce became a mother. Her drawing took second place and she became increasingly frustrated. The struggle for women artists to have space to work is a theme that pervades much of her writing. She voiced her frustrations through Henrietta, a heroine she created. This character was to become very important to her, and she claimed: 'Henrietta was part of me. I never quite knew where I ended and she began.' These were later compiled into <i>Henrietta's War</i>.Small wonder that the weekly installments of these endearing letters purportedly written to a friend at the front were eagerly awaited by the British during World War II. For the vignettes of "coping" in Devon are often so hilarious that you are surprised to find yourself wiping away a tear. Henrietta is an engaging character, with a son and a daughter in the services and a doctor husband who gives lectures about the digestive system and snores through air-raid alerts. There's also rotund, indomitable Lady B, ready to plunge into the ocean in pursuit of what looks like a mine; siren-like Faith, growing masses of geraniums to pat on her cheeks in the wartime absence of rouge; Mrs. Savernack, fainting dead away in a first-aid course and nearly killed in the crush of students avid to practice on her. The author's Hokinsonlike illustrations, her gentle wit and her concern for the sensibilities of all around her should guarantee as many delighted readers today as there were 45 years ago.

Butler of Texas has written a new book. Butler is not a new face in historical circles. He served as SAR President General, and Judge Advocate General of DVF. Butler, while SAR PG, gave new life to the long forgotten secret of the American Revolution. Although it wasn&#x2019;t a secret at the time of the American Revolution, it was regulated farther and farther back in the pages of history as time progressed.Washington&#x2019;s Secret Ally reveals the role of Spain in support of the thirteen colonies. Yes, we know about France, but Spain? In 2011 I attended a Texas DVF Brigade meeting and the speaker talked about the role of Spain in the American Revolution. I must admit this was news to me. Then Judge Butler wrote his first book, Galvez/Spain Our Forgotten Ally in the American Revolutionary War: A Concise Summary of Spain&#x2019;s Assistance. I had known that cattle arrived at Valley Forge from the Spanish held territory that is now Texas, but never knew the details of just how it had occurred. In June and September 1776, and again in June 1777 Spanish ships arrived in New Orleans laden with military supplies that were shipped to Fort Pitt by river boats.Spain had lost much of its foreign land holdings to Brittan which the king saw as a loss of honor for his family and the country. France had joined in the fight with the American colonies in 1778. In early 1779 France and Spain signed an agreement to jointly threaten and tie up the British military in other parts of the world. This strategy was carried out and worked. From Butlers first book we learned that Gen. Bernardo de Galvez was able to &#x201c;bottle up&#x201d; several thousand British troops in what would become Florida who could have easily moved north to help crush the revolution.Butler sets the stage to help us understand how things were played out in a global theater. It was not just a small war in the thirteen colonies, it was a world war. George Washington&#x2019;s Secret Ally is a shorter version of the original book, and is ideal for students and historians alike. It is packed full of dates, and photos. Its small size makes it ideal to carry along to read in airports, or on a break, wherever one has a few minutes to read. Indeed, without the intervention of France and Spain the American Revolution was doomed. Judge Butler is to be commended for refocusing the light on our Forgotten ally...Spain.</p><p></p><h2>Sniper, 2nd Edition: Training, Techniques and Weapons</h2><p><br><br>The first written use of the word "sniper" was in a soldier's letter from India in 1773, and in fact, the slaying of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by an enemy archer may well be one of the earliest recorded instances of the art of the sniper.

In this richly illustrated volume, renowned biographer Barry Paris offers the definitive biography of this fascinating and complex woman -- from her hardscrabble childhood in Sweden to her arrival in Hollywood at the age of nineteen, from her meteoric rise to stardom to her unintentional retirement from filmmaking at the height of her fame, from the new life she crafted for herself to her surprising, and failed, plans for a comeback. Drawing on hitherto unavailable material, including one hundred hours of tape-recorded conversations, fifty years of correspondence, and interviews with Garbo&#39;s surviving friends and family, Paris reveals the real woman behind the enigma.</p><p>BARRY PARIS is the author of Louise Brooks. His articles have appeared in the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and American Film. He lives in Pittsburgh with his wife, the actress and singer Myrna Paris, and their two children.Aficionados of early international and Hollywood filmmaking will find much of interest in this biography of Garbo. Anna Fields does an admirable job keeping the story moving as it weaves through the various periods of Garbo&#39;s life and discusses the many well-known people through whom the story is pieced together. Fields&#39;s sardonic and wry style fits well the public persona of Garbo. The one aspect of the book that makes the audio format tedious is the extensive quoting of taped telephone conversations between Sam Green and Garbo. The constant repetition of &#34;SG&#34; or &#34;GG&#34; to designate the speaker would be easily skimmed over in print. Moreover, despite assurances that Garbo realized the taping was being done, hearing these conversations gives one the uneasy sense of being an eaves-dropper on this woman who spent so much of her life guarding her privacy.

His ability to see through all the technical jargon associated with the golf swing, means that all players, whatever their level, can follow his teachings to get the most out of their game. Named after the red notebook Penick has always kept, this book is a collection of parables revealing the important truths behind the game of golf. It is full of useful advice not only for the keen golfer, but for pros and teachers as well. It is divided into a series of anecdotal lessons and teachings, from learning which club to use and practising the swing, through to overcoming bad habits and preparing for big matches. Holding the club &#34;like a musical instrument&#34;; letting confidence rub off on one by playing with a better golfer; &#34;powdering&#34; the ball to check on clubface address - these are just some of Harvey Penick&#39;s homespun tips on how to improve one&#39;s game.</p><p>Before titanium drivers, before oversized heads and bubble shafts, before electronic systems to tell you how far you are from the pin, golf was much the same game it is today. The lessons Harvey Penick taught in the pre-gadget days still stand. The golf swing is basically the same, and Penick could teach it better than anybody. For most of his life, he never intended to publish his <i>Little Red Book</i>, a notebook of golf wisdom and anecdotes that he compiled with the idea that he'd pass it on to his son. But, for the sake of history, it's a good thing that he changed his mind. Contained in its 175 pages is just about all you need to know about golf from a technical standpoint, along with Penick's priceless memories of working with famous pros, teaching absolute nobodies to get the ball in the air, and finding a horde of bat guano and hauling it across town in a pickup truck to fertilize his golf course. This book makes you feel good about playing golf, that you're part of something steeped in ritual and mystery and tradition, and that the game was played perfectly well before perimeter-weighted, graphite-shafted irons came along.Harvey Penick's life in golf began when he was eight years old, caddying at the Austin, Texas, Country Club. Eight decades later, he is still there, dispensing wisdom to pros and beginners alike. His stature in the golf world is reflected in the wide array of champions that he has worked with including those featured on this audio program, and it is not for nothing that the Teacher of the Year Award given by the Golf Teachers Association is called the Harvey Penick Award. Now after sixty years of keeping notes on the things he's seen and learned and on the golfing greats he's taught, Penick is finally letting the secrets in his Little Red Book be heard by the golf world. His simple, direct, practical wisdom pares away all the hypertechnical jargon that's grown up around the game, and lets all golfers play their best---whatever their level. Already a classic in hardcover, the audio adaptation of <i>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book </i>will be a constant source of guidance and inspiration to anyone who has ever stepped up to the first tee.</p><h2>Hogfather (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. The Hogswatchnight yuletide season is disrupted by the evil deeds of the Auditors, who replace the red-suited Hogfather with a scythe-bearing demon, prompting the Unseen University wizards and their monster-bashing nanny to launch a rescue plan.</p><p>What could more genuinely embody the spirit of Christmas (or Hogswatch, on the Discworld) than a Terry Pratchett book about the holiday season? Every secular Christmas tradition is included.

(You know him: red robe, white beard, says, "Ho, ho, ho!") Their evil plot will destroy the Discworld unless someone covers for him. So someone does. Well, at least Death <i>tries</i>. He wears the costume and rides the sleigh drawn by four jolly pigs: Gouger, Tusker, Rooter, and Snouter. He even comes down chimneys.

The lengthy introduction discusses the development of German names, name sources, name variations, and some of the special characteristics of German-American names. Here is explained the meanings of names borne today by Americans which derive from the German language or its dialects. It also deals with the Americanization of some of these names, explaining the social and historical matters that contributed to the distinctive character of German-American names. And it deals as well with names many of us would never have thought of as German. The vast amount of information on German-American names in this work is unequaled in any other book on this subject. This second edition is fifty pages longer than the previous edition and has several thousand more entries.</p><p>Most of us are curious about the meaning of our names. For those with names of German origin, this dictionary will satisfy that curiosity. There is a 60-page introduction that explains where German names came from and tells how to use the dictionary.

It&#x2019;s also America&#x2019;s most controversial sport, haunted by the specter of life-threatening injuries and plagued by scandal, even among its most venerable personalities and institutions. At the college level, we often tie football&#x2019;s tales of corruption and greed to its current popularity and revenue potential, and we have vague notions of a halcyon time&#x2014;before the new College Football Playoff, power conferences, and huge TV contracts. Perhaps we conjure images of young Ivy Leaguers playing a gentleman&#x2019;s game, exemplifying the collegial in collegiate. What we don&#x2019;t imagine is a game described in 1905 as &#x201c;a social obsession&#x2014;this boy-killing, man-mutilating, education-prostituting, gladiatorial sport.&#x201d;<br><br>In The Opening Kickoff, Dave Revsine tells the riveting story of the formative period of American football between 1890 and 1915. In just a quarter century football spread across the nation, captivating people from coast to coast. It was a time that saw the game&#x2019;s meteoric rise, fueled by overflow crowds, breathless newspaper coverage, and newfound superstars&#x2014;including one of the most thrilling and mysterious the sport has ever seen. But it was also a period racked by controversy in academics, recruiting, and physical brutality that, in combination, threatened football&#x2019;s very existence. A vivid storyteller, Revsine brings it all to life in this captivating narrative.<br></p><p><b>Dave Revsine</b> has been the lead studio host of the Big Ten Network since its inception in 2007.

The passion and the people of those early years, their feats, their foibles&#x2014;all contribute to this game taking root in the American heart. No other sport matters as much to fans of each team&#x2014;and Revsine&#x2019;s keen eye for detail, and clear love of the game make this a fascinating journey through an important time.

In Dave Revsine&#x2019;s fascinating read, The Opening Kickoff, we learn that college football&#x2019;s nascent seasons were as wild, unpredictable, and controversial as the ones that unfold in front of us now.

Donaldson &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Of all the strange, unrelenting stories which surrounded Reave the Just, none expressed his particular oddness of character better than that concerning his kinsman, Jillet of Forebridge. Part of the oddness was this--that Reave and Jillet were so unlike each other that the whole idea of their kinship became difficult to credit. Let it be said without prejudice that Jillet was an amiable fool. No one who was not amiable would have been loved by the cautious people of Forebridge--and Jillet was loved, of that there could be no doubt. Otherwise the townsfolk would never have risked the unpredictable and often spectacular consequences of sending for Reave, merely to inform him that Jillet had disappeared. And no one who was not a fool would have gotten himself into so much trouble with Kelven Divestulata that Kelven felt compelled to dispose of him. In contrast, neither Reave's enemies--of which his exploits had attracted a considerable number--nor his friends would have described him as amiable. Doubtless there were villages across the North Counties, towns perhaps, possibly a city or two, where Reave the Just was admired, even adulated: Forebridge was not among them. His decisions were too wild,his actions too unremitting, to meet the chary approval of the farmers and farriers, millers and masons who had known Jillet from birth. Like a force of nature, he was so far beyond explanation that people had ceased trying to account for him. Instead of wondering why he did what he did--or how he got away with it--the men and women of Forebridge asked themselves how such an implausible individual chanced to be kinsman to Jillet, who was himself only implausible in the degree to which likable character was combined with unreliable judgment. In fact, no one knew for certain that Reave and Jillet were related. Just recently, Jillet had upon occasion referred to Reave as, "Reave the Just, my kinsman." That was the true extent of the information available in Forebridge. Nothing more was revealed on the subject. In an effort to supply the lack, rumor or gossip suggested that Jillet's mother's sister, a woman of another town altogether, had fallen under the seduction of a carnival clown with delusions of grandeur--or, alternatively, of a knight errant incognito--and had given Reave a bastard birth under some pitiful hedgerow, or perhaps in some nameless nunnery, or conceivably in some lord's private bedchamber. But how the strains of blood which could produce Reave had been so entirely suppressed in Jillet, neither rumor nor gossip knew. Still it must have been true that Reave and Jillet were related. When Reave was summoned in Jillet's name, he came. By the time Reave arrived, however, Jillet was beyond knowing whether anyone valued him enough to tell his kinsman what had become of him. How he first began to make his way along the road to Kelven's enmity was never clearly known. Very well, he was a fool, as all men knew--but how had he become enmeshed in folly on this scale? A few bad bargains with usurers were conceivable. A few visits to the alchemists and mages who fed on the fringes of towns like Forebridge throughout the North Counties were conceivable, in fact hardly to be wondered at, especially when Jillet was at the painful age where he was old enough. to want a woman's love but too young to know how to get it. A few minor and ultimately forgettable feuds born of competition for trade or passion were not only conceivable but normal. Had not men and women been such small and harmless fools always? The folk of Forebridge might talk of such matters endlessly, seeking to persuade themselves that they were wiser. But who among them would have hazarded himself against Kelven Divestulata? Indeed, who among them had not at one time or anothersuspected that Kelven was Satan Himself, thinly disguised by swarthy flesh and knotted muscle and wiry beard? What in the name of all the saints had possessed Jillet to fling himself into such deep waters? The truth--which no one in Forebridge ever divined--was that Jillet brought his doom down on his own head by the simple expedient of naming himself Reave's kinsman. It came about in this fashion. In his early manhood, Jillet fell victim to an amiable, foolish, and quite understandable passion for the widow Huchette. Before his death, Rudolph Huchette had brought his new bride--foreign, succulent, and young--to live in the manor-house now occupied by Kelven Divestulata, thinking that by keeping her far from the taints and sophistication of the cities he could keep her pure. Sadly for him, he did not live long enough after settling in Forebridge to learn that his wife was pure by nature and needed no special protection. And of course the young men of the town knew nothing of her purity. They only knew that she was foreign, young, and bereaved, imponderably delicious. Jillet's passion was only one among many, ardent and doomed. The widow Huchette asked only of the God who watched over innocence that she be left alone. Needless to say, she was not. Realistically considered, the only one of her admirers truly capable of disturbing her was dour Kelven. When she spurned his advances, he laid siege to her with all the cunning bitterness of his nature. Over the course of many months, he contrived to install himself in the manor-house which Rudolph had intended as her lifelong home; he cut off her avenues of escape so that her only recourse was to accept the drudgery of being his housekeeper since she steadfastly refused the grim honor of being his wife. And even there he probably had the best of her, since he was no doubt perfectly capable of binding and raping her to satisfy his admiration. However, Jillet and the other men enamored of the widow did not consider her circumstances--and their own--realistically. As men in passion will, they chose to believe that they themselves were the gravest threat to her detachment. Blind to Kelven's intentions, Jillet and his fellow fools went about in a fog of schemes, dreaming of ways to persuade her to reveal her inevitable preference for themselves. However, Jillet carried this scheming further than most--but by no means all--of his peers. Perhaps because of his amiability--or perhaps because he was foolish--he was not ordinarily successful in competitions over women. His face and form were goodly enough, and his brown eyes showed pleasure as openly as any man's. His kindness and cheery temper endeared him throughout Forebridge. But he lacked forthrightness, self-assertion; he lacked the qualities which inspired passion. As with women everywhere, those of Forebridge valued kindness; they were fond of it; but they did not surrender their virtue to it. They preferred heroes--or rogues. So when Jillet first conceived his passion for the widow Huchette, he was already accustomed to the likelihood that he would not succeed. Like Kelven Divestulata after the first year or so of the widow's bereavement--although no one in Forebridge knew at the time what Kelven was doing--Jillet prepared a siege. He was not wise enough to ask himself, Why am I not favored in the beds of women? What must I learn in order to make myself desirable? How may I rise above the limitations which nature has placed upon me? Instead, he asked, Who can help me with this woman? His answer had already occurred to a handful of his brighter, but no less foolish, fellows. In consequence, he was no better than the fifth or sixth man of Forebridge to approach the best-known hedgerow alchemist in the County, seeking a love-potion. According to some authorities, the chief distinction between alchemists and mages was that the former had more opportunities for charlatanism, at less hazard. Squires and earls consulted mages: plowmen and cotters, alchemists. Certainly, the man whom Jillet approached was a charlatan. He admitted as much freely in the company of folk who were wise enough not to want anything from him. But he would never have revealed the truth about himself to one such as Jillet. Charlatan or not, however, he was growing weary of this seemingly endless sequence of men demanding love-potions against the widow Huchette. One heartsick swain by the six-month or so may be profitably bilked. Three may be a source of amusement. But five or six in a season was plainly tedious. And worrisome as well: even Forebridge was capable of recognizing charlatanism when five or six love-potions failed consecutively. "Go home," the alchemist snapped when he had been told what Jillet wanted. "The ingredients for the magick you require are arduous and expensive to obtain. I cannot satisfy you." But Jillet, who could not have put his hand on five farthings at that moment, replied, "I care nothing for the price. I will pay whatever is needed." The dilemma of cost had never entered his head, but he was certain it could be resolved. The widow Huchette had gold enough, after all. His confidence presented an entirely different dilemma to the alchemist. It was not in the nature of charlatans to refuse money. And yet too many love-potions had already been dispensed. If Providence did not inspire the widow to favor one of the first four or five men, the alchemist's reputation--and therefore his income--would be endangered. Perhaps even his person would be endangered. Seeking to protect himself, the alchemist named a sum which should have stunned any son of a cotter. Jillet was not stunned. Any sum was acceptable, since he had no prospect of ever paying it himself. "Very well," he said comfortably. Then, because he wished to believe in his own cleverness, he added, "But if the potion does not succeed, you will return that sum with interest." "Oh, assuredly," replied the alchemist, who found that he could not after all refuse money. "All of my magicks succeed, or I will know the reason why. Return tomorrow. Bring your gold then." He closed his door so that Jillet would not have a chance to change his mind. Jillet walked home musing to himself. Now that he had time to consider the matter, he found that he had placed himself in an awkward position. True, the love of the widow Huchette promised to be a valuable investment--but it was an investment only, not coin. The alchemist would require coin. In fact, the coin was required in order to obtain the investment. And Jillet had no coin, not on the scale the alchemist had mentioned. The truth was that he had never laid mortal eyes on that scale of coin. And he had no prospects which might be stretched to that scale, no skills which could earn it, no property which could be sold for it. Where could a man like Jillet of Forebridge get so much money? Where else? Congratulating himself on his clarity of wit, Jillet went to the usurers. He had had no dealings with usurers heretofore. But he had heard rumors. Some such "lenders" were said to be more forgiving than others, less stringent in their demands. Well, Jillet had no need of anyone'sforgiveness; but he felt a natural preference for men with amiable reputations. From the honest alchemist, he went in search of an amiable usurer. Unfortunately, amiable, forgiving usurers had so much kindness in their natures because they could afford it; and they could afford it because their investments were scantly at risk: they demanded collateral before hazarding coin. This baffled Jillet more than a little. The concept of collateral he could understand--just--but he could not understand why the widow Huchette did not constitute collateral. He would use the money to pay the alchemist; the alchemist would give him a love-potion; the potion would win the widow; and from the widow's holdings the usurer would be paid. Where was the fallacy in all this? The usurer himself had no difficulty detecting the fallacy. More in sorrow than in scorn, he sent Jillet away. Other "lenders" were similarly inclined. Only their pity varied, not their rejection. Well, thought Jillet, I will never gain the widow without assistance. I must have the potion. So he abandoned his search for an amiable usurer and committed himself, like a lost fish, to swim in murkier waters. He went to do business with the kind of moneylender who despised the world because he feared it. This moneylender feared the world because his substance was always at risk; and his substance was always at risk because he required no collateral. All he required was a fatal return on his investment. "One fifth!" Jillet protested. The interest sounded high, even to him. "No other lender in Forebridge asks so much." "No other lender in Forebridge," wheezed the individual whose coin was endangered, "risks so much." True, thought Jillet, giving the man his due. And after all one fifth was only a number. It would not amount to much, if the widow were won swiftly. "Very well," he replied calmly. "As you say, you ask no collateral. And my prospects cannot fail. One fifth in a year is not too much to pay for what I will gain, especially"--he cleared his throat in a dignified fashion, for emphasis--"since I will only need the use of your money for a fortnight at most." "A <i>year</i>?" The usurer nearly burst a vessel. "You will return me one fifth <i>a week</i> on my risk, or you can beg coin of fools like yourself, for you will get none from me!" One fifth in a week. Perhaps for a moment Jillet was indeed stunned. Perhaps he went so far as to reconsider the course he had chosen. One fifth in a week, each and every week--And what if the potion failed? Or if it was merely slow? He would never be able to pay that first one fifth, not to mention the second or the third--and certainly not the original sum itself. Why, it was ruinous. But then it occurred to him that one fifth, or two fifths, or twenty would make no difference to the wealth of the widow Huchette. And he would be happy besides, basking in the knowledge of a passion virtuously satisfied. On that comfortable assumption, he agreed to the usurer's terms. The next day, laden with a purse containing more gold than he had ever seen in his life, Jillet of Forebridge returned to the alchemist. By this time, the alchemist was ready for him. The essence of charlatanism was cunning, and the alchemist was nothing if not an essential charlatan. He had taken the measure of his man--as well as of his own circumstances--and had determined his response. First, of course, he counted out Jillet's gold, testing the coins with spurious powders and honest teeth. He produced a few small fires and explosions, purely for effect: like most of his ilk, he could be impressive when he wished. Then he spoke. "Young man, you are not the first to approach me for a potion in this matter. You are merely the first"--he hefted the purse--"to place such value on your object. Therefore I must give you a magick able to supersede all others--a magick not only capable of attaining its end, but in fact of doing so against the opposition of a--number--of intervening magicks. This is a rare and dangerous enterprise. For it to succeed, you must not only trust it entirely, but also be bold in support of it. "Behold!" The alchemist flourished his arms to induce more fires and explosions. When an especially noxious fume had cleared, he held in his palm a leather pouch on a thong. "I will be plain," said the alchemist, "for it will displease me gravely if magick of such cost and purity fails because you do not do your part. This periapt must be worn about your neck, con...</p><h2>Saskatchewan, a history</h2><p>A detailed history of Saskatchewan</p><p></p><h2>Looking back with Jesse Alexander: A collection of the author&#39;s photographs of European motor racing from the adventurous years between 1954 and 1967</h2><p>1982.

The courtyard became a major architectural design element almost as soon humans began constructing permanent buildings. </p> <p>Scholars tell us that courtyards have been around since at least 3000 b.c. The earliest civilizations in China, the Middle East, and North Africa all had courtyards. Protection was the primary function of these early courtyards, with high walls providing a shield from the weather and a barrier to marauding animals and unwanted human visitors. In later western culture, the requirements of a courtyard were looser, and any area that was partially or entirely enclosed by walls or buildings could be called a courtyard.</p> <p>Today, defining a courtyard seems to depend on the elements it contains and the feelings it evokes rather than the architecture that surrounds it. The basic elements of a courtyard have always been water, walls, and sky combined to convey qualities of intimacy, security, and quiet.</p></p><h2>The Windsor Style in America: A Pictorial Study of the History and Regional Characteristics of the Most Popular Furniture Form of 18th Century Ameri</h2><p>Shows various styles of Windsor chairs, traces their history in the U.S., and discusses their identification marks and construction</p><p></p><h2>Becoming the Tupamaros: Solidarity and Transnational Revolutionaries in Uruguay and the United States</h2><p>In <i>Becoming the Tupamaros</i>, Lindsey Churchill explores an alternative narrative of US-Latin American relations by challenging long-held assumptions about the nature of revolutionary movements like the Uruguayan Tupamaros group.

Brown, David Finch, Don Gardner, Gwenyth Hoyle, Fred Johnston, John Jennings, Kenneth R. Lister, Ted Moores, Rick Nash, and James Raffan to create this book. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p> <p> The canoe is an enduring symbol of wilderness and freedom throughout North America. Hand-made vessels moved people and goods for centuries before Europeans arrived, providing an excellent and practical mode of transportation that developed regionally to serve the needs of the Native peoples. Canoes were used by hunters, travelers, traders and warriors. The canoes of various regions went through many transformations after the Europeans came. In the eighteenth century birchbark canoes grew larger and wider to carry big loads of furs in the exploding fur trade market. Then in 1865 the canoe was made smaller and fitted with decks to become the <i>Rob Roy</i>, a little canoe designed by John MacGregor to carry him on long trips across Europe. In the 1850s the wooden building form was invented, using an overturned dugout as a mold, to create a method of building wooden canoes in quantity to satisfy the growing market of recreational paddlers. Factories sprang up in Peterborough, Ontario, in Maine and in New Brunswick, supplying cedar-strip canoes for surveyors, missionaries, hunters, Mounties and campers. The canoe was made lighter and longer for racing and was sometimes fitted out with a sail. In the latter half of the twentieth century aluminum, Kevlar and fiberglass were used to make canoes and kayaks, and the designs changed once again to accommodate the new materials. </p><p> But the North American Native canoe went through many transformations long before Samuel de Champlain decided it was the best way to get around in the immense new continent he was exploring. Across North America different Native groups developed the canoe to suit their needs and environment, making their boats from the materials at hand. Birchbark was used in the wide path across the central and northern half of the continent where the tree grew in huge forests that covered the landscape. The inferior elm bark was awkwardly wrapped around a frame further south where birch trees weren't available. In the cold, unforested regions of the Arctic, driftwood, stunted trees and sealskin were used to build kayaks, with the distinctive characteristic of covered decks. Huge red cedars and gigantic spruce were felled to carve dugouts on the wet and rainy west coast. </p><p> The shape and size of Native watercraft varied according to their environment and purpose. The Mi'kmaqs on the east coast built carefully designed long birchbark canoes with inward sloping upper sides (tumblehome) to maneuver through the swells of the Atlantic Ocean on their fishing expeditions. The Algonquin, Montagnais, Cree and Ojibwa crafted beautiful, featherlight birchbark canoes that were easy to portage over the rough terrain between the rivers of the northeastern and central regions of the birchbark belt. Northwest of Hudson Bay, where trees were stunted, the Dogrib people built small, light canoes, often patching the bark together from birch or spruce trees, because the trees were too small to provide the large sections of bark used in canoe making further south. The Inuit hunted seals in the icy waters of the Arctic in sleek kayaks, boats that were easy to negotiate through the ocean, sturdy enough to carry home heavy loads, but light enough to transport over the ice. Another, lesser-known cousin of the canoe in the north, was the umiak, called the "women's boat": a large, wide boat built on a wooden frame lashed together and covered with sealskin or walrus hide. These were used for whale and big game hunting, war parties and transporting people and their goods over long distances. On the west coast the Native peoples designed their own forms of the ocean-going dugout for whale hunting, fishing and warfare. </p><p> When the French arrived in the early seventeenth century, they quickly adapted Native canoes to their own use. Soon huge, thirty-six-foot Montreal canoes were being paddled by teams of voyageurs across hundreds of miles, laden with beaver pelts to be made into hats and other products, bound for the European markets. With white settlement the canoe began to have a new role as a recreational vessel, and builders experimented with various methods to produce canoes in quantity. Canoe races were held at local regattas and the American Canoe Association, then the Canadian Canoe Association, were founded, and the classification of boats in races became a science. Many refinements and design innovations were developed to make the boats lighter and faster. The international sport of canoe and kayak racing was born. </p><p> Anthropologists and historians study canoes to understand the cultures that used them. The materials and building methods and the design of the boats can reveal valuable information about how the Native peoples survived in what was often a very harsh environment. In this book, twelve authors, each an expert in his or her field, write about different canoes, kayaks and umiaks in North America: how they were built, how they were used and how they affected the history of this continent. The design of these boats is described in detail in terms of their function, with the traditional methods of building the craft carefully explained. </p><p> By their very nature, canoes are transitory. Birchbark and animal skins deteriorate quickly when exposed to the elements. For a long time people did not consider them worthy of preserving, but in the twentieth century a movement began to conserve our history as embodied in the canoe. Two of the contributors to that history are Tappan Adney and Kirk Wipper. Tappan Adney was a scholar who single handedly recorded and saved hundreds of canoe designs. Working with decaying specimens, drawings and oral accounts, he built perfect models. Kirk Wipper, who ran a children's camp in central Ontario, began to rescue canoes from across the continent, and over nearly forty years he built up one of the largest collections of canoes in the world. When it outgrew the log building it was housed in at his camp, the Canadian Canoe Museum was created and a permanent home was found for the collection in Peterborough, Ontario. </p><p> Many of the vintage canoes from the Canoe Museum grace the pages of this book. Northern birchbarks, Naskapi crooked canoes, Salish dugouts, Greenland kayaks, Peterborough cedar strips and Old Town wood-canvas canoes drift through the chapters, perfect unto themselves, highly functional, energy efficient, lovingly crafted boats that all have a story to tell. Throughout the centuries and its many transformations in North America, the canoe has evolved and endured, a living tradition that continues to serve and delight the people who take it on the water. </p></p><h2>Just Add Color on the Go: 100 Designs to Relax and Color Anywhere, Anytime - Includes Botanical, Folk Art, and Geometric artwork + 6 Full-color Prints by Lisa Congdon!</h2><p><p><b>Reconnect with your inner creativity...on the go!</b></p><p>Who doesn't love to color?

She writes under the pseudonym Claribel Alegrï¿½a. She has been called "one of the region's finest writers" by <i>The Washington Post. </i>She has published over forty books including fifteen collections of poetry, and is a recipient of the Casa de las Americas Prize of Cuba. Her works in English include<i>Ashes of Izalco, Luisa in Realityland, </i>and <i>Family Album. </i><p>In 1947 Alegrï¿½a married the U.S.-born journalist Darwin J. ("Bud") Flakoll; they had three daughters and one son. Flakoll coauthored some of her novels and translated much of her work into English. He died in 1995. Alegrï¿½a's<i> Sorrow</i>, a collection of love poems, was written for her deceased husband.</p>In a novel that blends politics, history and romance with unfailing gentleness, unforeseeable, explosive events determine the actions of the characters but never interrupt the work's lyrical structure. Carmen Rojas, the heroine, was a child when, in 1932, she witnessed the brutality of the El Salvadoran National Guard, who murdered 30,000 rioting peasants. The tragedy shapes her political consciousness, and, although she marries an American and lives in Washington, D.C., she cannot escape its memory. Thirty years later, she returns home to attend her mother's funeral and to care for her sickly father, and discovers a diary kept by her mother's American lover in the months before the 1932 uprisings. Through her poetry and journals, Alegria ( Woman of the River ) has distinguished herself to many American readers, but this novel, written with her American husband, a former journalist, will astonish even those familiar with her consummate skill. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>What&#39;s the Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian?: A Guide to What Matters Most</h2><p>Pastor and author Martin Thielen has compiled a list of ten things Christians need to believe--and ten things they don't--to be Christians. This lively and engaging book will be a help to seekers as well as a comfort to believers who may find themselves questioning some of the assumptions they grew up with.<p>Many people in the twenty-first century hunger for an expression of Christian faith that is different from the judgmental and narrow-minded caricatures they see on television or in the news. With an accessible style that's grounded in solid biblical scholarship, Thielen shows how Christians don't need to believe that sinners will be "left behind" to burn in hell or that it's heresy to believe in evolution. And while we must always take the Bible seriously, we don't always have to take it literally. At the same time, Christians do need to believe in Jesus--his life, his teachings, his death and resurrection, and his vision for the world. Thielen articulates centrist, mainline Christianity in a way that's fresh and easy to understand and offers authentic Christian insights that speak to our deepest needs.</p><p>This is an ideal book for individual, group, or congregational study. </p></p><p>Martin Thielen is Senior Pastor of Brentwood United Methodist Church in Brentwood, Tennessee.

Consulting via satellite e-mail with doctors in the United States, she was forced to perform a biopsy and treat herself with chemotherapy in order to ensure that she could survive until conditions permitted her rescue. She was eventually rescued by the Air National Guard. Dr. Jerri Nielsens story of her transforming experiences is a thrilling adventure and moving drama. She has written a new chapter for this edition. Since the publication of Ice Bound in hardcover in January 2000, Dr. Nielsen has inspired people throughout the country, met hundreds of fans, received numerous awards including Irish American of the Year, which was presented to her by Hillary Clinton, as well as tremendous praise from the media.</p><p>Serving as doctor to the Americans "wintering over" at the South Pole in 1999, Jerri Nielsen made headlines when she discovered a lump in her breast that a self-administered biopsy revealed to be an aggressive, fast-growing cancer. No flights in or out of Antarctica are possible during the continent's long winter, and Nielsen's account of giving herself chemotherapy while she and her fellow "Polies" waited for the weather to break is even more gripping than the news reports at the time. She's candid about her pain and fear; the media battle waged by her embittered ex-husband makes her ordeal even more challenging. Interestingly enough, however, this high drama does not overshadow Nielsen's deeper narrative of a woman who came "to the Ice" seeking new meaning in a life shattered by divorce and estrangement from her children. In the back-to-basics world of Antarctic medicine, with outdated equipment, few supplies, and no assistants, she rediscovered her vocation as a doctor, free from the imperatives of corporate-directed medicine. More importantly, Nielsen found spiritual solace in the world's most extreme environment, where she was "introduced slowly to the notion of giving more than you have and using less than you need ... of knowing that all you really own are your own thoughts." She makes the glories of the Pole so palpable that, by the end, readers will not even be surprised when she signs an e-mail to her family, "from the wonderful Ice." <i>--Wendy Smith</i><strong>Dr. Jerri Nielsen</strong> worked for many years as an emergency room doctor before becoming the team physician at the Amundsen-Scott station in Antarctica.

A moment later he not only heard the rumble but felt the pounding in the earth of hundreds of horses. Out of the north he saw the growing mass of a mighty army approaching.

Porunth broke off from the rest and came to him.<br><br>&#x201c;You look well, my friend.&#x201d; Porunth smiled as he spoke above the thundering sound.

Finally, I am well.&#x201d; Gavinaugh returned the smile.<br><br>Porunth nodded. &#x201c;You have partaken of the character of the Prince.

He watched the Prince&#x2019;s army diminish in the distance.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess my travels will begin on foot,&#x201d; he said aloud and looked toward the forest from which he had come weeks earlier.<br><br>Just then a horse neighed loudly a short distance behind him, and Gavinaugh nearly jumped out of his armor. He turned to see a sight that delighted his soul.<br><br>&#x201c;Triumph?&#x201d;<br><br>He ran to the horse and could hardly contain his joy. &#x201c;Triumph...it is you! How can this possibly be?&#x201d;<br><br>Triumph seemed pleased to see Gavinaugh as well. He stroked the horse&#x2019;s neck and felt as though they were once again a team. In examining the horse, he noticed the scar on Triumph&#x2019;s shoulder, but otherwise he seemed healthy and whole.<br><br>He mounted Triumph and looked forward to his course back home.<br><br>After many days of traveling, Gavinaugh arrived in the Chessington Valley. He timed his arrival at dusk, for he was unsure of the status of the city and of the Noble Knights. He knew he must face Kifus one day, but now was not the time, for such an encounter would only hinder his call to the greater purpose of life.<br><br>He took the back alleyways to the home of a man named Tarill. He dismounted and knocked quietly at the back door, as he had done many times before. The door opened slightly, and a stout-looking man with a scraggly beard peered out.<br><br>&#x201c;What in the...&#x201d; The man opened the door to allow Gavinaugh entrance and then looked outside after him to confirm that no one was watching. He quickly closed and locked the door and turned to face Gavinaugh. This was no joyous reunion.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard you were dead...or worse,&#x201d; Tarill said bluntly.<br><br>Gavinaugh did not respond. He produced a small bag that jingled with coins. &#x201c;Where do they meet now?&#x201d;<br><br>Tarill laughed. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve come to finish the job you started, eh? I guess I know which rumors to believe.&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh was becoming uncomfortable, for here in the home of his old informant he was dramatically facing the reality of his former life.<br><br>&#x201c;Just tell me the location, and I&#x2019;ll be on my way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Double the fee, and I will hand their leaders to you on a silver platter!&#x201d; Tarill seemed thrilled with the prospect.<br><br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An acquaintance of mine has gained the trust of two of their leaders, Barrett and William. He told me that there is a meeting arranged with one of the Followers from an Outdweller haven. With a little persuasion I can convince him to tell me the location. You and your men could take them with ease.&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh thought for a moment and realized that this would be his best opportunity to reach the Knights of the Prince.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well. I will agree on one condition. No one else, not even the Noble Knights, are to be told. Is that clear?&#x201d;<br><br>Tarill&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;All right, I can agree to that. What have you got up your sleeve, Gavin?&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh looked at the man fiercely. &#x201c;If you betray me, Tarill, my next hunt will be for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh paid the man and left.<br><br>Two nights later, Gavinaugh cautiously approached a shop in the northern part of Chessington. He found an alcove and watched from the shadows of the night. The air was thick and still. He spotted the door that led to the chamber where the meeting was to be. The sounds of a city settling down for the night mixed with the chirp of crickets and an occasional barking hound. He was apprehensive, for he was not completely confident that Tarill could be trusted. He was a man who made his living on deception and on bartering one deal for another. Loyalty was not part of his character. Even if Tarill chose not to betray him, Gavinaugh wasn&#x2019;t sure how the Knights of the Prince would respond to him. Although he carried his sword, he knew that he could never draw it upon a fellow Knight of the Prince, even if it meant the end of his life.<br><br>After a long wait, Gavinaugh was fairly confident that no one was nearby. He walked to the door. He looked up and down the alley one more time, took a deep breath, then opened the door and stepped inside.<br><br>As he closed the door, his back was to the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Finally, you&#x2019;ve arrived,&#x201d; a man said.<br><br>Gavinaugh turned and faced the men.<br><br>&#x201c;Were you delayed, Sir&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>Before him stood two men in tunics bearing the mark of the Prince. One was a bit shorter and nearly bald. Gavinaugh immediately recognized the taller, dark-haired knight as one of the first men he captured a long time ago. Gavinaugh had questioned him in the cells of the prison. The recognition was mutual, as evidenced by the look of shock on the man&#x2019;s face.<br><br>Both men immediately drew their swords and looked to the doors of the shop, apparently expecting a full ambush to crush down upon them.<br><br>Gavinaugh held up his hand. &#x201c;I am alone, gentlemen. Please do not be alarmed.&#x201d;<br><br>The tension in the room was thick. Both men were poised in a fight-ready stance. Gavinaugh wondered if they would run him through and flee, but they did not attack.<br><br>The shorter man slowly moved to the front door.<br><br>&#x201c;Check the street,&#x201d; the taller man said.<br><br>The other man opened the door a crack. &#x201c;Two Noble Knights!&#x201d; he said in a hushed tone.<br><br> &#x201c;They are not with me. I didn&#x2019;t come to fight you. Please believe me,&#x201d; Gavinaugh said.<br><br>The two men gripped their swords tighter and took a step toward Gavinaugh.<br><br>&#x201c;You are Sir Gavin, the Tyrant of Chessington. Why should we believe you?&#x201d; the taller man said as he pointed his sword at him. Just then the door behind Gavinaugh began to open, and dread filled his heart.<br><i><br>Tarill must have betrayed me! </i>He turned toward the door and drew his sword. Only then did he realize his error. He was in the presence of men who regarded him as an enemy. With his sword in his hand, their perception was undeniable.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a trick!&#x201d; the shorter man exclaimed.<br><br>As they rushed upon Gavinaugh, he turned to face them and lowered his sword. The two men brought their swords back to strike. For a moment Gavinaugh wondered if his mission would be over before it began, but they did not finish their attack. It seemed to Gavinaugh as though they could not attack one who would not defend himself.<br><br>&#x201c;We are among friends, gentlemen. Please lower your swords,&#x201d; a familiar voice said from behind Gavinaugh.<br><br>A Knight of the Prince entered and stood among the odd trio. The tension in the room abated somewhat.<br><br>&#x201c;Weston, this is Gavin, the Noble Knight. He is here to either kill or capture us!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Sir William. I can assure you that he is not here for that,&#x201d; Weston replied.<br><br>The two men were clearly struggling with seeing Gavinaugh as anything but a ruthless persecutor of the Followers of the Prince. They did not lower their swords.<br><br>Weston walked between his friends and Gavinaugh. He turned his back to Gavinaugh and opened his arms to the two knights. Now their swords were pointed at Weston&#x2019;s chest.<br><br>&#x201c;He is a fellow Knight of the Prince. I give you my life as my word.&#x201d;<br><br>They lowered their swords but did not appear convinced. Gavinaugh sheathed his sword.<br><br>&#x201c;Barrett, check the door again,&#x201d; William said.<br><br>&#x201c;All clear,&#x201d; Barrett replied.<br><br>Weston turned to face Gavinaugh, and the two embraced. &#x201c;It is good to see you again, my friend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Your timing is impeccable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir William, Sir Barrett, meet Sir Gavinaugh of Chessington,&#x201d; Weston said.<br><br>With a sober heart, Gavinaugh spoke. &#x201c;I have caused you and many others great suffering, and for that I am truly sorry. Were it not for the transforming power of the Prince, I would not be standing before you this evening. Please know that my heart beats with the sole purpose of proclaiming the Prince as the true Son of the King. I join my sword and my life to yours in this great mission.&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh extended his left hand. William hesitated and then took it.<br><br>&#x201c;The ways of the Prince are for everyone, even for one such as you,&#x201d; William said, and Gavinaugh remembered William speaking those words from long ago when he thought William to be a crazy man.<br><br>Barrett also accepted Gavinaugh&#x2019;s hand.<br><br>&#x201c;I am no longer Gavin of Chessington, but Gavinaugh of Arrethtrae, for the Prince has made all things new in me. I apologize for the abrupt meeting, good sirs. My association with the Knights of the Prince is rather limited at this time, and I had no other way to contact you.&#x201d;<br><br>Barrett sheathed his sword. &#x201c;Your disappearance was a great mystery to many in the city.We would love to hear your story.&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh smiled and knew in his heart that this was the first of many opportunities he would have to share his story.<br><br>&#x201c;I have been with the Prince...&#x201d; As Gavinaugh told all to William and Barrett, his zeal for the Prince spilled into every word that came from his lips, and soon the men had become his loyal brothers as well.<br><br>&#x201c;We must take you to Cedric. He will want to know of the great work the Prince has done in you,&#x201d; William said. &#x201c;Weston, bring Gavinaugh to the haven tomorrow evening, and we will prepare Cedric and the others for his visit.&#x201d;<br><br>William turned to Gavinaugh. &#x201c;We hope your next encounter with the Knights of the Prince will not be quite as intense.&#x201d;<br><br>Gavinaugh laughed. &#x201c;Indeed!&#x201d;</p><h2>What Are Universities For?</h2><p>Across the world, universities are more numerous than they have ever been, yet at the same time there is unprecedented confusion about their purpose and scepticism about their value. What Are Universities For? offers a spirited and compelling argument for completely rethinking the way we see our universities, and why we need them. Stefan Collini challenges the common claim that universities need to show that they help to make money in order to justify getting more money. Instead, he argues that we must reflect on the different types of institution and the distinctive roles they play. In particular we must recognize that attempting to extend human understanding, which is at the heart of disciplined intellectual enquiry, can never be wholly harnessed to immediate social purposes - particularly in the case of the humanities, which both attract and puzzle many people and are therefore the most difficult subjects to justify. At a time when the future of higher education lies in the balance, What Are Universities For? offers all of us a better, deeper and more enlightened understanding of why universities matter, to everyone.</p><p>Stefan Collini has become one of the most respected voices in public debates about universities and their place in modern society.He is a Professor of Intellectual History and English Literature at Cambridge University and Fellow of the British Academy, who frequently contributes to The Guardian,The London Review of Books,The Times Literary Supplement and The Nation.Reviewers of the recent, Common Reading: Critics, Historians,Publics (2008), described him as &#39;one of Britain&#39;s finest essaysists and writers.&#39;Other works include Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain (2006),Public Moralists (1991),Matthew Arnold: a Critical Portrait (1994) and English Pasts: Essays in History and Culture (1999).An eloquent and impassioned book * Economist * Collini is astute, analytical, and often killingly funny -- Bevis Hillier * Daily Telegraph * Collini is that rare bird, a don who can be read with pleasure -- Michael Barber * Tablet, Books of the Year * One of Britain&#39;s finest essayists and writers -- Ronan McDonald * The Times Higher Education Supplement * [A] timely lecture for the coalition of dunces ... this is a closely argued defence * Independent on Sunday * The book is a bit like some university courses. It is erudite, well argued, carefully researched, a fine addition to the debate about the purpose of university education * Scotsman * [Collini is] stern and splendid in his brief history of the hot debate on useful versus useless knowledge -- Fred Inglis * Times Higher Education * It is extremely well written: Collini&#39;s prose is lively, well-reasoned and persuasive. The book is a refreshing example of a faculty member engaging with the wider issues of higher education rather than perceiving them through the narrow prism of his own discipline ... a valuable, timely contribution to the discourse -- Gerry Wrixon * Irish Examiner * A critique both pointed and witty -- Howard Newby * Independent * Collini writes beautifully -- Chris Patten * Financial Times * Collini puts his finger on the nub of the problem facing universities.

His two daughters - Scottie, a feisty ten-year-old, and Alex, a teenage recovering drug addict - are out of control; his thrill-seeking, high-maintenance wife, Joanie, lies in a coma after a boat-racing accident and will soon be taken off life support. Suddenly the King family must come to terms with this tragedy - and with the shameful sense of freedom that comes with it. As Matt gathers Joanie&#39;s friends and family to say their final goodbyes, a difficult situation is made worse by the discovery that one person hasn&#39;t been told - the man with whom Joanie has been having an affair. Forced to examine what he owes not only to the living but also to the dead, Matt takes to the road with his daughters to find his wife&#39;s lover on a memorable journey of painful revelations and unforeseen humor.</p><p>Kaui Hart Hemmings is the author of the critically acclaimed short-story collection House of Thieves. Her writing has appeared in Zoetrope, Best American Voices 2006, and Best American Nonrequired Reading 2004. Hemmings grew up in Hawaii and lives with her husband and daughter in San Francisco.1<br><br>the sun is shining, mynah birds are chattering, palm trees are swaying, so what. I&#x2019;m in the hospital and I&#x2019;m healthy. My heart is beating as it should. My brain is firing off messages that are loud and clear. My wife is on the upright hospital bed, positioned the way people sleep on airplanes, her body stiff, head cocked to the side. Her hands are on her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we lay her flat?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; my daughter Scottie says. She takes a picture of her mother, a Polaroid. She fans herself with the photo, and I press the button on the side of the bed to lower my wife&#x2019;s upper body. I release the button when she is almost flat on her back.<br><br>Joanie has been in a coma for twenty-three days, and in the next few days I&#x2019;ll have to make some decisions based on our doctor&#x2019;s final verdict. Actually, I&#x2019;ll just have to find out what the doctor has to say about Joanie&#x2019;s condition. I don&#x2019;t have any decisions to make, since Joanie has a living will. She, as always, makes her own decisions.<br><br>Today is Monday. Dr. Johnston said we&#x2019;ll talk on Tuesday, and this appointment is making me nervous, as though it&#x2019;s a romantic date. I don&#x2019;t know how to act, what to say, what to wear. I rehearse answers and reactions, but I&#x2019;ve nailed only the lines that respond to favorable scenarios. I haven&#x2019;t rehearsed Plan B.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Scottie says. Her real name is Scottie. Joanie thought it would be cool to name her after Joanie&#x2019;s father, Scott. I have to disagree.<br><br>I look at the photo, which looks like those joke snapshots everyone takes of someone sleeping. I don&#x2019;t know why we think they&#x2019;re so funny. There&#x2019;s a lot that can be done to you while you&#x2019;re sleeping. This seems to be the message. Look how vulnerable you are, the things you aren&#x2019;t aware of. Yet in this picture you know she isn&#x2019;t just sleeping. Joanie has an IV and something called an endotracheal tube running out of her mouth to a ventilator that helps her breathe. She is fed through a tube and is administered enough medication to sustain a Fijian village. Scottie is documenting our life for her social studies class. Here&#x2019;s Joanie at Queen&#x2019;s Hospital, her fourth week in a coma, a coma that has scored a 10 on the Glasgow scale and a III on the Rancho Los Amigos scale. She was in a race and was launched from an offshore powerboat going eighty miles an hour, but I think she will be okay.<br><br>&#x201c;She reacts nonpurposefully to stimuli in a nonspecific manner, but occasionally, her responses are specific though inconsistent.&#x201d; This is what I&#x2019;ve been told by her neurologist, a young woman with a slight tremor in her left eye and a fast way of talking that makes it hard to ask questions. &#x201c;Her reflexes are limited and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented,&#x201d; she says. None of this sounds good to me, but I&#x2019;m assured Joanie&#x2019;s still holding on. I feel she&#x2019;ll be okay and one day able to function normally. I&#x2019;m generally right about things.<br><br>&#x201c;What was she racing for?&#x201d; the neurologist asked.<br><br>The question confused me. &#x201c;To win, I guess. To get to the end first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;shut this off,&#x201d; I tell Scottie. She finishes pasting the picture into her book then turns off the television with the remote.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I mean this.&#x201d; I point to the stuff in the window&#x2014;the sun and trees, the birds on the grass hopping from crumb to crumb thrown by tourists and crazy ladies. &#x201c;Turn this off. It&#x2019;s horrible.&#x201d; The tropics make it difficult to mope. I bet in big cities you can walk down the street scowling and no one will ask you what&#x2019;s wrong or encourage you to smile, but everyone here has the attitude that we&#x2019;re lucky to live in Hawaii; paradise reigns supreme. I think paradise can go fuck itself.<br><br>&#x201c;Disgusting,&#x201d; Scottie says. She slides the stiff curtain across the window, shutting all of it out.<br><br>I hope she can&#x2019;t tell that I&#x2019;m appraising her and that I&#x2019;m completely worried by what I see. She&#x2019;s excitable and strange. She&#x2019;s ten. What do people do during the day when they&#x2019;re ten? She runs her fingers along the window and mumbles, &#x201c;This could give me bird flu,&#x201d; and then she forms a circle around her mouth with her hand and makes trumpet noises. She&#x2019;s nuts. Who knows what&#x2019;s going on in that head of hers, and speaking of her head, she most definitely could use a haircut or a brushing. There are small tumbleweeds of hair resting on the top of her head. Where does she get haircuts? I wonder. Has she ever had one before? She scratches her scalp, then looks at her nails. She wears a shirt that says i&#x2019;m not that kind of girl. but i can be! I&#x2019;m grateful that she isn&#x2019;t too pretty, but I realize this could change.<br><br>I look at my watch. Joanie gave it to me.<br><br>&#x201c;The hands glow and the face is mother-of-pearl,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;How much did it cost?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;How did I know that would be the very first thing you said about it?&#x201d;<br><br>I could see she was hurt, that she put a lot of work into selecting the gift. She loves giving gifts, paying attention to people so she can give them a gift that says she took the time to know and listen to them. At least it seems like that&#x2019;s what she does. I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked about the price. She just wanted to show that she knew me.<br><br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; Scottie asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Ten-thirty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I say. I don&#x2019;t know what to do. We&#x2019;re here not only because we&#x2019;re visiting and hoping Joanie has made some progress during the night, reacting to light and sound and painful jabs, but also because we have nowhere else to go. Scottie&#x2019;s in school all day and then Esther picks her up, but this week I felt she should spend more time here and with me, so I took her out of school.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want to do now?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>She opens her scrapbook, a project that seems to occupy all of her time. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Eat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you usually do now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be in school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What if it were Saturday? What would you do then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Beach.&#x201d;<br><br>I try to think of the last time she was completely in my care and what we did together. I think it was when she was around one, one and a half. Joanie had to fly to Maui for a shoot and couldn&#x2019;t find a babysitter, and her parents couldn&#x2019;t do it, for some reason. I was in the middle of a trial and stayed home but absolutely had to get some work done, so I put Scottie in the bathtub with a bar of soap. I watched to see what happened. She splashed and tried to drink the bathwater, and then she found the soap and reached to grab it. It eluded her grasp and she tried again, a look of wonder on her small face, and I slipped out into the hall, where I had set up a workstation and a baby monitor. I could hear her laughing, so I knew she wasn&#x2019;t drowning. I wonder if this would still work: putting her in a tub with a slippery bar of Irish Spring.<br><br>&#x201c;We can go to the beach,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Would Mom take you to the club?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, duh. Where else would we go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s a plan. After you talk and we see a nurse, we&#x2019;ll check in at home, then go.&#x201d;<br><br>Scottie takes a picture out of her album, crushes it in her hand, and throws it away. I wonder what the picture was, if it was the one of her mother on the bed, probably not the best family relic. &#x201c;I wish,&#x201d; Scottie says. &#x201c;What do I wish?&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s one of our games. Every now and then she names a place she wishes we were besides this place, this time in our lives.<br><br>&#x201c;I wish we were at the dentist,&#x201d; she decides.<br><br>&#x201c;Me, too. I wish we were getting our mouths x-rayed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Mom was getting her teeth whitened,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>I really do wish we were at Dr. Branch&#x2019;s office, the three of us getting high on laughing gas and feeling our numb lips. A root canal would be a blast compared to this. Or any medical procedure, really. Actually, I wish I could be home working. I have to make a decision on who should own the land that has been in my family since the 1840s. This sale will eliminate all of my family&#x2019;s land holdings, and I desperately need to study up on the facts before the meeting I have with my cousins six days from now. That&#x2019;s our deadline. Two o&#x2019;clock at Cousin Six&#x2019;s house six days from today. We&#x2019;ll approve a buyer. It&#x2019;s irresponsible of me to have put off thinking about this deal for so long, but I guess this is what our family has done for a while now. We&#x2019;ve turned our backs to our legacy, waiting for someone else to come along and assume both our fortune and our debts.<br><br>I&#x2019;m afraid Esther may have to take Scottie to the beach, and I&#x2019;m about to tell her, but then I don&#x2019;t because I feel ashamed. My wife is in the hospital, my daughter needs her parents, and I need to work. Once again I&#x2019;m putting her in the tub.<br><br>I see Scottie staring at her mother. She has her back against the wall, and she&#x2019;s fumbling with the hem of her shirt.<br><br>&#x201c;Scottie,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not going to say anything, then we may as well leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to tell your mother what&#x2019;s going on in school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She never cares about what&#x2019;s going on in school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about your extracurricular activities? Your schedule&#x2019;s fuller than the president&#x2019;s. Your scrapbook, show her that.

We've all asked ourselves this question at some point, but few of us have found the path to lasting fulfillment. David Michie thought he had achieved his life's goals&#x2014;the high-level job, the expensive city apartment, the luxury car, the great vacations&#x2014;but a small voice was telling him he wasn't really happy. A chance remark from a naturopath sent him to his local Buddhist center. There he began the most important journey of his life. <br><br>In this simple but beautifully written book, David Michie opens the door to the core teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. With wry, self-deprecating humor, he shows us how he began to incorporate Buddhist practices into his daily life. He explains how he came to understand the difference between the temporary pleasures of ordinary life and the profound sense of well-being and heartfelt serenity that comes from connecting with our inner nature.</p><p>David Michie is a corporate communications consultant, published novelist, and Buddhist practitioner. He lives in Perth, Australia.A novelist and former Type A executive offers a touching memoir about how Tibetan Buddhism transformed his life. Anesthetized by the mind&#39;s internal chatter and the temporary pleasures of modern life, many people overlook the freedom they have to choose their internal reactions to life&#39;s insults and tragedies. They&#39;re trapped by their habits and appetites, oppressed by the impulse to control everything. With his nuanced phrasing and perfectly natural diction, British actor Nicholas Bell adds enormous appeal to this elegant personal lesson. His understated vocal presence, combined with the author&#39;s humility and practical grasp of his subject, gives the production irresistible charm and accessibility. This beautifully rendered, beguiling introduction to meditation and Buddhist thought will help listeners consider realms of being they don&#39;t ordinarily visit. T.W.

In this guide, he presents his knowledge of the essentials of screenwriting and storytelling.</p><p>Writing for the screen is quirky business. A writer must labor meticulously over his or her prose, yet very little of that prose is ever heard by filmgoers. The few words that do reach the audience, in the form of the characters' dialogue, are, according to Robert McKee, best left to last in the writing process. ("As Alfred Hitchcock once remarked, 'When the screenplay has been written and the dialogue has been added, we're ready to shoot.' ") In <i>Story</i>, McKee puts into book form what he has been teaching screenwriters for years in his seminar on story structure, which is considered by many to be a prerequisite to the film biz. (The long list of film and television projects that McKee's students have written, directed, or produced includes <i>Air Force One</i>, <i>The Deer Hunter</i>, <i>E.R.</i>, <i>A Fish Called Wanda</i>, <i>Forrest Gump</i>, <i>NYPD Blue</i>, and <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>.) Legions of writers flock to Hollywood in search of easy money, calculating the best way to get rich quick. This book is not for them. McKee is passionate about the art of screenwriting. "No one needs yet another recipe book on how to reheat Hollywood leftovers," he writes. "We need a rediscovery of the underlying tenets of our art, the guiding principles that liberate talent." <i>Story</i> is a true path to just such a rediscovery. In it, McKee offers so much sound advice, drawing from sources as wide ranging as Aristotle and <i>Casablanca</i>, Stanislavski and <i>Chinatown</i>, that it is impossible not to come away feeling immeasurably better equipped to write a screenplay and infinitely more inspired to write a brilliant one.<i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Robert McKee teaches his 3Story Structure2 class annually to sold out auditoriums in Los Angeles, New York, London and film capitals throughout the world.

Now, returning to her aging parents with her young daughter, she has resigned herself to the life of a widow. With a subdued but cheerful heart she helps her family run a bed-and-breakfast in a quaint Lancaster county town. Philip Bradley, a world-weary journalist from New York City on assignment in Lancaster to write an article on the Amish community, is a lodger at the Yoder's B&amp;B. A chance discovery by Philip of a postcard written in illegible Pennsylvania Dutch in the dresser of his room sets off a series of events that leads him into the heart of the Amish life and to the bedside of a mysterious woman known as "The Storyteller." With the postcard as a link to a haunted past, the woman gradually weaves a riveting tale as old as herself about a community shuttered in secrecy, shattered by betrayal. Fascinated by the story, Philip's and Rachel's lives become inevitably intertwined despite the attempts of the community to protect her from the outsider. Torn by devotion to the people she loves and the awakening feelings in her heart, Rachel searches her past to restore old wounds in order than new love might grow.</p><p><b>Beverly Lewis</b> is a former teacher and the author of fifty books, including The Sunroom, THE HERITAGE OF LANCASTER COUNTY, SUMMERHILL SECRETS for preteens, and most recently, a rollicking picture book called <i>Cows in the House</i>.

They begin with the murder. But the murder is the <i>end</i>. The story begins long before that." So remarks esteemed criminologist Mr. Treves. Truer words have never been spoken, for a psychopathic killer has insinuated himself , with cunning manipulation, into a quiet village on the river Tern. But who is his intended victim? What are his unfathomable motives? And how and when will he reach the point of murder...the zero point? In the ingenious and noteworthy departure for Agatha Christie, it's the intricate workings of a pathological mind that becomes the stuff of startling mystery as group of friends at a seaside resort remain blithely unaware that their weekend will be the death of them all...<br></p><p><p>What is the connection among a failed suicide attempt, a wrongful accusation of theft against a schoolgirl, and the romantic life of a famous tennis player?</p><p>To the casual observer, apparently nothing.

Two of the characters she created, the brilliant little Belgian Hercule Poirot and the irrepressible and relentless Miss Marple, went on to become world-famous detectives. Both have been widely dramatized in feature films and made-for-TV movies. </p><p> Agatha Christie also wrote under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott.

At age twenty-four, unable to pay for college, he works as a doorman, until a statue of an Arab raising a cup of coffee awakens something in him. He sets out to learn the rich history of coffee in Yemen and the complex art of tasting and identifying varietals. He travels to Yemen and visits countless farms, collecting samples, eager to bring improved cultivation methods to the countryside. And he is on the verge of success when civil war engulfs Yemen in 2015. The US Embassy closes, Saudi bombs began to rain down on the country, and Mokhtar is trapped in Yemen. Desperate to escape, he embarks on a passage that has him negotiating with dueling political factions and twice kidnapped at gunpoint. With no other options, he hires a skiff to take him, and his coffee samples, across the Red Sea. A heart-pounding true story that weaves together the history of coffee, the ongoing Yemeni civil war, and the courageous journey of a young man--a Muslim and a US citizen--following the most American of dreams.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2018:</strong> <em>The Monk of Mokha</em> is an unblinking, open account of a San Francisco-based Yemeni American&#x2019;s success story. The sincerity and subject matter will make some cynics uneasy, and cynics would do well to avoid this book, or be less cynical. Following in the path of <em>What is the What</em> and <em>Zeitoun</em>, Eggers delivers us the real-life tale of Mokhtar Alkhanshali, a Muslim in his early twenties who appears to be on his way to a relatively undistinguished life. But when he discovers the historic Yemeni connection to coffee production, he embarks on a quest that will change his path and provide direction. The adventure itself is riveting, but when you add in the history of coffee, the story becomes even more elevated. Mokhtar is an inspirational character, and Dave Eggers has written an entertaining, inspirational, and informative book. -- <em>Chris Schluep for the Amazon Book Review</em><b>Dave Eggers</b> grew up near Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I suppose I can mark the place with a cross.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, you have a compass, and take bearings,' retorted his wife. &#x2018;Come on in, and we'll show you.'</p> <p>They turned away from the tennis-court and began to walk back towards the house down one of the neglected paths that wound between flower-beds to the terrace on the south side of the building.</p> <p>&#x2018;Chas, can you look at it with the sun on that heavenly grey stone, and blame us for refusing to part with it?' Margaret exclaimed.</p> <p>&#x2018;I'll wait till I've seen my room,' Charles replied.</p> <p>But he had to admit that this house, which had been left to his wife and her brother and sister, was artistically all that could be desired. Built originally many hundreds of years before of grey stone, much of it was now ruined, and much had been added at different periods, so that the present house was a rambling structure, set in wooded grounds where oaks, which had been there when the Conqueror landed, reared up huge gnarled trunks from out of a tangle of undergrowth. A drive of about a quarter of a mile in length twisted through the trees to the gates that opened on to the road which led to the village of Framley, a mile away if you went by road, but much less if you walked across the fields at the back of the house.</p> <p>Down the road towards the village, but set back inside the Priory grounds, were the ruins of the chapel which had so captivated Celia's fancy. Dismantled during the Reformation, and later battered by Cromwell's cannon, not much of it now remained, but fragments of the walls rose up crumbling out of the grass. Here and there part of the walls remained to show the Gothic windows, but for the most part they were no more than a few feet in height.</p> <p>The Priory itself had been restored so that the many rebuildings and additions had left little outward appearance of the old home of the monks. Celia, who had acquired a book on Old Abbeys, declared that the library, a big room giving on to the terrace, was the original refectory, but she admitted that the panelling was probably of later date.</p> <p>The place had come to her quite unexpectedly. An uncle whom she, in company with Peter and Margaret, had visited at dutiful intervals during his lifetime, had bequeathed the Priory to his nephew and his two nieces. No lover of rural solitudes, he himself had never occupied the house. In his turn he had inherited it some five years before from his sister, who had lived there through marriage and widowhood. As she left it so it now stood, and no sooner had Celia Malcolm, and Peter and Margaret Fortescue seen it, than they declared it was just the place they had dreamed of for years. At least, the two sisters said so. Peter was less enthusiastic, but agreed it would be a pity to sell it.</p> <p>It had been to let for quite a long time, but ever since the first tenants who rented the house two years after the death of its original owner, had left, no one had made even the smallest offer for it.</p> <p>&#x2018;Your uncle had a good deal of trouble over the house,' had said Mr Milbank, the solicitor. &#x2018;When she lived in it his sister never made any complaint, but she was an eccentric old lady, and it's conceivable she wouldn't have cared. But the fact of the matter is, Mrs Malcolm, the house has got rather a bad name. The people your uncle let it to took it for three years and they left at the end of one. They said the place was haunted.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oo!' said Margaret. &#x2018;What a thrill for us!'</p> <p>The lawyer smiled. &#x2018;I shouldn't build on it, Miss Fortescue. I think you'll find that it's nothing more thrilling than rats. But I thought I'd warn you. So that if you feel you'd rather not take possession of a reputedly haunted house you might like me to follow up this offer.' He lifted up a sheet of note-paper that lay on his desk, and looked inquiringly at Peter.</p> <p>&#x2018;Is that the offer you wrote to us about?' Peter asked. &#x2018;Some fellow who saw the board up when he was motoring in that part of the world, and wanted to know particulars?'</p> <p>Mr Milbank nodded. Celia and Margaret turned anxiously to their brother, and began to urge the desirability of owning a country house so near to town, and yet so ideal in situation and character.</p> <p>The trout stream won Peter over. Charles, a young barrister with a growing practice, had no time to waste, so he said, in going to look at a house which his wife was apparently set on inhabiting whether he liked it or not. He placed his trust in Peter.</p> <p>&#x2018;And nicely you've abused it,' he said, over tea in the library. &#x2018;For two months you three have dashed to and fro, doing what you called "getting it ready to live in." Incidentally you lulled my suspicions with lying stories about the house, till I almost believed it was something like your description. You' he pointed an accusing finger at Margaret &#x2018;said it was the ideal home. The fact that there was only one bathroom and a system of heating water that won't do more than one hot bath at a time, you carefully concealed.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Do you good to have a few cold baths,' remarked Peter, spreading jam on a slice of bread and butter. &#x2018;It isn't as though we propose to live here through the winter. Moreover, I don't see why we shouldn't convert one of the bedrooms into a second bathroom, and put in a better heating arrangement. Not immediately, of course, but at some future date.'</p> <p>Charles eyed him coldly. &#x2018;And what about light? Oh, and a telephone! I suppose we can wire the house while we're about it. This must be what Celia called "getting a country-house for nothing." I might have known.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Personally,' said Celia, &#x2018;I prefer lamps and candles. Electric light would be out of place in a house like this, and as for a telephone, that's the one thing I've been wanting to escape from.' She nodded briskly at her husband. &#x2018;You're going to have a real holiday this year, my man, quite cut off from town.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Thanks very much,' said Charles. &#x2018;And what was it you said just before tea? Something about going to the village to order bacon for breakfast?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, you can take the car,' Celia pointed out. &#x2018;And you might try and get hold of a gardener in the village. I think the garden is rather more than you and Peter can manage.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It is,' said Charles, with conviction. &#x2018;Much more.'</p> <p>The door opened at that moment to admit a middle-aged lady of comfortable proportions, and placid demeanour. This was Mrs Bosanquet, the Fortescues' aunt. She accepted a chair, and some tea, condemned a solid-looking cake, and embarked on bread and butter.</p> <p>&#x2018;I have unpacked my boxes,' she announced, &#x2018;but I twice lost the wardrobe.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What, have you got one of those little practical jokes?' Charles demanded.</p> <p>Mrs Bosanquet turned an amiable and inquiring countenance towards him. She was deaf. When Charles had repeated his question, she nodded. &#x2018;Yes, dear, but I have stuck a piece of stamp-paper on the catch. A very quaint old house. I was talking to Mrs Bowers, and she tells me you could lose yourself in the cellars.'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's nothing,' said Charles, getting up. &#x2018;I lost myself getting from our room to my dressing-room. Of course it would simplify matters if we locked a few of the empty rooms, but I agree it would take away from the sporting element. Are you coming to the village, Peter?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I am,' Peter replied. &#x2018;I will introduce you to some very fine draught beer there.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Lead on!' Charles said, brightening.</p> <p>The lane that led to Framley was wooded, and picturesque enough to draw a grudging word of approval from Charles. Peter, negotiating a hairpin bend, said: &#x2018;Seriously, Chas, the place has possibilities.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't deny it. But what's all this bilge about noises and hauntings, and footsteps in the dark?'</p> <p>&#x2018;God knows. In the village they all but cross themselves if you mention the Priory. I daresay there are rats. Milbank said...'</p> <p>&#x2018;Look here, do you mean to say you knew about this haunting before you came down here? And not one word to me?'</p> <p>Peter said in some surprise: &#x2018;I didn't think anything of it. You aren't going to tell me you'd have refused to live in the place if you'd known?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Aren't I?' said Charles grimly. &#x2018;If you'd left as many desirable residences and hotels at a moment's notice as I have, all because Celia "felt something queer" about them, you'd never have come near the place.'</p> <p>&#x2018;She says she doesn't believe there's anything wrong with the house. All village superstition.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Does she? Well, I'll lay you six to one in sovereigns that the first rat heard scuttling overhead will spell our departure. Especially with Bowers shivering round the house.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What's the matter with him? Been listening to village gossip?'</p> <p>&#x2018;That, and natural palsy of spirit. He unpacked my things and gave a life-like imitation of the mysterious butler of fiction while he did so. "All I know is, sir, I wouldn't go down those cellar stairs after dark, not if I were paid to." Oh yes, and I need hardly say that the first night he and Mrs Bowers spent alone in the house before you came down, he heard footsteps outside his door, and a hand feeling over the panels.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Silly ass!' Peter said. &#x2018;You can console yourself with the thought that it would take more than a ghost to upset the redoubtable Mrs Bowers. Allow me to tell you that we are now approaching the Bell Inn. Genuine fourteenth century in parts.'</p> <p>The car had emerged from the tree-shadowed lane into the outskirts of the village, which stretched aimlessly along one narrow main street. The Bell Inn, a picturesque and rambling old hostelry built round a courtyard, was one of the first buildings on the street. Peter Fortescue ran the car up to the door and switched off the engine. &#x2018;Opening time,' he grinned. &#x2018;Take heart, Chas, I can vouch for the beer.'</p> <p>They entered into a long, low-pitched taproom, with a beamed ceiling, and little latticed windows that gave on to the street. Oak settles formed various secluded nooks in the room, and behind the bar stood a landlord of such comfortable proportions and such benevolent mien that he might well have stepped from the pages of Dickens.</p> <p>Leaning against the bar, and apparently engaging Mr Wilkes in desultory conversation, was his very antithesis, a thin, wiry little man, with a very sharp face and pale eyes that darted from object to object with a quickness that gave a disagreeable impression of shiftiness. He glanced at Peter as Peter crossed the threshold, and at once looked away again.</p> <p>&#x2018;Evening, Wilkes,' Peter said. &#x2018;I've brought my brother-in-law along to try that draught bitter of yours.'</p> <p>Mr Wilkes beamed upon them both. &#x2018;Very glad to see any friend of yours here, sir. Two half-cans, sir? You shall have it.' He took down a couple of pewter tankards from a shelf behind him, and drew two half-pints of frothing beer. Having supplied his patrons with this, he wiped down the bar with a mechanical action, and said affably: &#x2018;And how are you getting on up at the Priory, sir, if I may ask?'</p> <p>&#x2018;All right, thanks. We haven't seen your ghost yet. When does he usually show up?'</p> <p>The smile faded. Mr Wilkes looked at Peter rather queerly, and said in an altered voice: &#x2018;I wouldn't joke about it, sir, not if I was you.'</p> <p>Charles emerged from his tankard. &#x2018;Has my man Bowers been in here at all?' he demanded.</p> <p>The landlord looked surprised; the small stranger, who had edged away a little when the newcomers first entered, shot a quick look at Charles.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, sir, several times,' Wilkes answered.</p> <p>&#x2018;I thought so,' said Charles. &#x2018;And did you tell him that the ghost prowled round the passages, and pawed all the doors?'</p> <p>Wilkes seemed to draw back. &#x2018;Has he heard it again?' he asked.</p> <p>&#x2018;Heard my eye!' Charles retorted. &#x2018;All he heard was what you told him, and his own imagination.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Joking apart, Wilkes, you don't really believe in the thing, do you?' Peter asked.</p> <p>The small man, who had looked for a moment as though he were going to say something, moved unobtrusively away to a seat by one of the windows, and fishing a crumpled newspaper from his pocket began to read it.</p> <p>For a moment Wilkes did not reply; then he said quite simply: &#x2018;I've seen it, sir.' Peter's brows lifted incredulously, and Wilkes added: &#x2018;And what's more, I've seen as reasonable a man as what you are yourself pack up and leave that place with two years of his lease still to run. A little over five years it is since I took over this house, and when I first come here the Priory was standing as empty as when you first saw it. I suppose old Mrs Matthews, that used to own it, had been dead a matter of a year or fifteen months. From all accounts she was a queer one. Well, there was the Priory, going to ruin, as you might say, and never a soul would go near the place after dark, not if they was paid to. Now, I daresay you'll agree I don't look one of the fanciful ones myself, sir, and nor I'm not, and the first thing I did when I heard what folk said of the place, was to make a joke of it, like what you're doing now. Then Ben Tillman, that keeps the mill up to Crawshays, he laid me I wouldn't go up to the old ruin after dark one night.' He paused, and again wiped down the bar with that odd air of abstraction. He drew a long breath, as though some horror still lingered in his memory. &#x2018;Well, I went, sir. Nor I wasn't afraid not then. It was a moonlit night, and besides that I had my torch if I'd needed it. But I didn't. I sat down on one of those old tombs you'll find in the chapel, half covered by grass and weeds. I didn't think anything out of the ordinary for some while. If I remember rightly, I whistled a bit, by way of passing the time. I couldn't say how long it was before I noticed the change. I think it must have come gradual.'</p> <p>&#x2018;What change?' asked Charles, unimpressed.</p> <p>Again the landlord paused. &#x2018;It's very hard to tell you, sir. It wasn't anything you could take hold of, as you might say. Things looked the same, and there wasn't more than a breath of wind, yet it got much colder all at once. And it was as fine a June night as you could hope for. I don't know how I can explain it so as you'd understand, but it was as though the cold was spreading right over me, and into me. And instead of whistling tunes to myself, and thinking how I'd have the laugh over Ben Tillman, I found I was sitting still still as death. It had sort of crept on me wi...</p></p><h2>Edmund and the White Witch (The World of Narnia)</h2><p>In <em>Edmund and the White Witch, </em>Edmund finds himself in Narnia, where the White Witch feeds him Turkish Delight and makes him promise to return with his brother and sisters.

These illustrations are given more importance than the texts, which provide just the bare bones of the plot. However, the pictures, as well executed as they are, nevertheless constrain the imagination. And the narratives pale as introductions to Lewis's exquisite prose and his much greater ability to tell a story with subtlety, symbolism, and nuance. Audio versions of Lewis's originals are far better choices, especially for those unable to take on Lewis's prose so early in their reading careers.?Ruth K.

Carter played a central role in crafting the legal strategy for the pivotal cases of the civil rights era&#x2014;arguing and winning over twenty pivotal cases before the Supreme Court, including <i>Brown v. Board</i>, with Thurgood Marshall.<i> A Matter of Law</i> is the extraordinary story of Carter&#x2019;s struggle for equal rights for all Americans.</p><p>Carter&#x2019;s history with the NAACP during its pivotal years (1945&#x2013;1968) is at the center of this memoir, which offers a rare personal account of how the legal campaign in <i>Brown</i> was mounted. In the aftermath of <i>Brown</i>, Carter turned his attention to broadening the application of <i>Brown</i> to challenge racial inequality in Northern schools. His account of the NAACP&#x2019;s efforts to expose the pervasive nature of school segregation in the North brings this history to the forefront for the first time&#x2014;and is essential to any discussion of the limitations of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>Carter&#x2019;s post&#x2013;NAACP career enabled him to participate in and reflect on the fight for racial justice from a variety of vantage points, most recently as a federal district judge in New York. He brings a fresh and critical perspective to bear on the long-term consequences of the civil rights movement and the need for new and innovative approaches to the continuing struggle for racial justice in America.</p><br></p><p>Judge Robert L. Carter (1917&#x2013;2012) was United States District Judge in the Southern District of New York. Judge Carter was a graduate of Lincoln University, the Howard University School of Law, and Columbia University Law School, and received numerous honorary degrees and awards.<br>In this dry but intriguing memoir, Carter, a U.S. District judge in New York, offers an insider's account of the legal battle to end segregation in the United States. Having served as Thurgood Marshall's chief legal assistant and then as General Counsel to the NAACP, Carter was pivotal in winning the Brown v. Board of Education case that outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Carter begins by describing his impoverished New Jersey childhood, the deaths of three of his siblings and the educational discrimination that "toughened him for later battles with racism." Although he also recounts his college years and his tumultuous experience in the army, Carter devotes most of the book to his legal career, detailing the events and strategies that led to the Brown vs. Board triumph. Perhaps most fascinating is Carter's take on the power struggles within the NAACP. Carter had a tepid relationship with Marshall, and he admits to feeling "hurt and angry" at being overlooked as his successor. Indeed, some may wonder if he still harbors a little of that anger; his portrayal of Marshall as a high-stakes gambler and an ambitious man who discarded people when their "usefulness to him was over" is less than flattering. Still, those who can take these details with a grain of salt and overlook Carter's plodding prose will find this a unique perspective on how the Civil Rights victory was won. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She plans only to check on her ailing mother and leave. But Tilly decides to stay, and though she is still an outcast, her lush, exquisite dresses prove irresistible to the prim women of Dungatar.

Behind her the bus roared away, the tail-lights shrinking, but she could hear the footsteps approaching.</p><p>&#x2018;Myrtle Dunnage, my, my.&#x2019;</p><p>Myrtle quickened her pace. So did Sergeant Farrat. He inspected her fine boots &#x2013; <i>Italian?</i> he wondered &#x2013; and her trousers, definitely not serge.</p><p>&#x2018;Myrtle, let me help you.&#x2019;</p><p>She walked on, so the sergeant lunged, wrenching the domed box from her hand, spinning her around. They stood and stared at each other, the white air swirling around them. Tilly had grown into a woman while Sergeant Farrat had aged. He raised one pale hand to his mouth in embarrassment, then shrugged and headed for his car with the luggage. When he&#x2019;d thrown the last of Myrtle&#x2019;s suitcases onto the back seat, he opened the passenger door for her and waited. When she was in he swung the car about and headed east. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll take the long way home,&#x2019; he said. The knot in the pit of Tilly&#x2019;s stomach hardened.</p><p>They glided through the fog and as they rounded the football oval, Sergeant Farrat said, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re third from the top of the ladder this year.&#x2019;</p><p>Tilly was silent.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ve come from Melbourne, have you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; she answered flatly.</p><p>&#x2018;Home for long?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not sure.&#x2019;</p><p>They drove back through the main street. When they passed the school hall she heard the childhood cries of Friday afternoon softball games and shrieks and splashes from swimming carnivals at the creek. When Sergeant Farrat turned the library corner towards The Hill, she smelled the library&#x2019;s waxed lino floor, and saw a flash of wet blood on the dry grass outside. Memories of being driven to the bus stop all those years ago by the same man rose up, and the knot in her stomach turned.</p><p>Finally the police car ground its way to the top of The Hill and stopped. She sat looking at her old home while the sergeant looked at her. Little Myrtle Dunnage had alabaster skin and her mother&#x2019;s eyes and hair. She seemed strong, but damaged.</p><p>&#x2018;Does anyone know you&#x2019;re coming, Myrtle?&#x2019; asked the sergeant.</p><p>&#x2018;My name is Tilly,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Everyone will know soon enough.&#x2019;</p><p>She turned to look at Sergeant Farrat&#x2019;s expectant face in the foggy moonlight. &#x2018;How is my mother?&#x2019; she asked.</p><p>He opened his car door. &#x2018;Your mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doesn&#x2019;t get out these days,&#x2019; he said, and climbed from the car. The fog resting around the veranda moved like frills on a skirt as the sergeant moved through it with Tilly&#x2019;s suitcases. He held the heavy dome. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve a lovely sewing machine, <i>Tilly</i>,&#x2019; he said.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m a seamstress and dressmaker, Sergeant Farrat.&#x2019; She opened the back door.</p><p>He clapped his hands. &#x2018;Excellent!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Thanks for the lift.&#x2019; She closed the back door on him.</p><p>As he drove away, Sergeant Farrat tried to remember the last time he&#x2019;d visited Mad Molly. He hadn&#x2019;t seen her for at least a year, but knew Mae McSwiney kept an eye on her. He smiled. &#x2018;A dressmaker!&#x2019;</p><p>Molly&#x2019;s house was dank and smelled like possum piss. Tilly felt along the dusty wall for the light switch and turned it on, then moved through the kitchen to the lounge room, past the crusty old lounge suite to the fireplace. She put her hand to the ash. It was stone cold. She made her way over to her mother&#x2019;s bedroom door, turned the knob and pushed. A dull lamp glowed in the corner by the bed.</p><p>&#x2018;Mum?&#x2019;</p><p>A body stirred under piled blankets. A skeleton head wearing a tea cosy turned on a grubby kapok pillow. The mouth gaped like a charcoal hole, and sunken eyes gazed at her.</p><p>Molly Dunnage, mad woman and crone, said to her daughter, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve come about the dog, have you? You can&#x2019;t have him. We want to keep him.&#x2019;</p><p>She gestured at a crowd of invisible people around her bed. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t we?&#x2019; She nodded at them.</p><p>&#x2018;This is what they&#x2019;ve done to you,&#x2019; said Tilly.</p><p>A mitten, stiff and soiled, came from under the blankets. Molly looked at her skinny wrist. &#x2018;Half past four,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>Tilly unpacked the bottle of brandy she&#x2019;d bought for her mother and sat on the back veranda looking down at the dull forms of Dungatar at slumber. She wondered about what she had left behind her, and what she had returned to.</p><p>At dawn she sighed and raised a glass to the small grey town and went inside. She evicted snug families of mice from between the towels in the linen press and spiders from their lace homes under light shades. She swept dust, dirt, twigs and a dead sparrow from the bath and turned on the taps to scrub it. The water ran cold and brown and when it flowed clear and hot, she filled the bath, then added lavender flowers from the garden. She tugged her mother from her crusty bed and pulled her tottering towards the bath. Mad Molly cursed, scratched and punched Tilly with Daddy Long Legs limbs, but soon tired and folded easily into the water.</p><p>&#x2018;Anyway,&#x2019; she snapped, &#x2018;everyone knows red jelly stays harder longer,&#x2019; and she cackled at Tilly with green gums and lunatic eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;Give me your teeth,&#x2019; said Tilly. Molly clamped her mouth shut. Tilly pressed Molly&#x2019;s forearms across her chest, pinning her, then pinched her nostrils until Molly opened her mouth to breathe. She prised the teeth out with a spoon and dropped them into a bucket of ammonia. Molly yelled and thrashed about until she was exhausted and clean and, while she soaked, Tilly stripped the beds. When the sun was high she dragged the mattresses out onto the grass to bake.</p><p>Later she tucked Molly&#x2019;s scrawny frame back into bed and spooned her sweet black tea, talking to her all the while. Molly&#x2019;s answers were maniacal, angry, but answers just the same. Then she slept, so Tilly cleaned out the stove, gathered kindling from the garden and lit a fire. Smoke ballooned up the chimney and a possum in the roof thumped across the beams. She threw open all the doors and windows and started flinging things out &#x2013; an ancient sewing machine and a moth-eaten dress stand, a wringer washing machine shell, old newspapers and boxes, dirty curtains and stiff carpet pieces, a couch and its ruined chairs, broken tables, empty tin cans and glass bottles. Soon the little weatherboard house stood stump deep in rubbish.</p><p>When Molly woke, Tilly walked her all the way down to the outhouse where she sat her on the toilet with her bloomers around her ankles and her nightie tucked up into her jumper. She tied her hands to the toilet door with her dressing gown cord so that she would not wander off. Molly bellowed at the top of her old lungs until she was hoarse. Later, Tilly heated tinned tomato soup and sat her mother in the sun &#x2013; emptied, cleaned and wrapped in jumpers, gloves, cap, socks, slippers and blankets &#x2013; and fed her. All the while Mad Molly prattled. Tilly wiped her mother&#x2019;s sauce-red mouth. &#x2018;Did you enjoy that?&#x2019;</p><p>Her mother replied formally, &#x2018;Yes thank you, we always do,&#x2019; and smiled graciously to the others attending the banquet, before vomiting over the strange woman she thought was feeding her poison.</p><p>Again Tilly stood on the veranda, the breeze pressing her trousers against her slim legs. Below her, smoke circled from beneath a copper in the McSwineys&#x2019; yard at the base of The Hill beside the tip. Strangers assumed the bent railway carriages and dented caravans were part of it, but it was where the McSwiney family lived. Edward McSwiney was Dungatar&#x2019;s night cart man. He could negotiate every outhouse, every full dunny can in Dungatar &#x2013; even on the blackest, windiest nights &#x2013; without spilling a drop. During the day he also delivered things, riding around on his cart with his middle son Barney and a bunch of kids hanging off the back.</p><p>Little Myrtle used to watch the McSwiney kids playing: the oldest boy, a few years younger than herself, then three girls and Barney, who was &#x2018;not quite finished&#x2019;. He was crooked, with an upside-down head and a club foot.</p><p>The town itself rested in the full glare of the morning sun. The railway station and the square, grey silo sat along the railway line, whose arc held the buildings against the bend of the Dungatar creek, like freckles on a nose. The creek had always been low, choked with willows and cumbungi weed, the flow sluggish and the water singing with mosquitos. The pioneer founders of Dungatar had allowed a flood plain along its inner curve, which was now a park of sorts with a community hall in the middle, Mr and Mrs Almanac&#x2019;s low damp cottage at the eastern end opposite their chemist shop, and the school at the western edge, where Prudence Dimm had taught the children of Dungatar for as long as anyone could remember. The main road followed the curve of the park, separating it from the commercial strip. The police station was situated out along the road to the east, halfway between the cemetery and the town&#x2019;s edge. It was not a busy road and there were few shops at its kerb, the chemist shop, then the Station Hotel, and then A and M Pratt, Merchant Supplies &#x2013; a general store which sold everything anyone needed. The post office, bank and telephone exchange were housed together in the next building, and the last, most western building was the shire office and library combined. The houses of Dungatar, dotted behind the commercial strip, were dissected by a thin gravel road that ran to the football oval.</p><p>The green eye of the oval looked back up at Tilly, the cars around its edge like lashes. Inside, her mother stirred and called, and the possum thumped across the ceiling again.</p><p>Tilly went to the dress stand lying on the grass. She stood it up and then hosed it down, leaving it to dry in the sun.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On Saturday mornings the main street of Dungatar sang to the chug of farm trucks and solid British automobiles bearing smart pastoralist families. Younger children were passed into the care of older siblings, and sent to the park so mothers could shop and gossip. Men stood in clumps talking about the weather and looking to the sky, and thin-skinned, thick-boned women in floral sunfrocks and felt hats sat behind trestle tables selling raffle tickets.</p><p>Sergeant Farrat made his way past a young man slouched behind the wheel of a dusty Triumph Gloria and across the road towards Pratts. He encountered Mona Beaumont on the footpath outside.</p><p>&#x2018;Good morning, Mona,&#x2019; he called. &#x2018;I see you have your brother safely at home.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mother sa-ays we can let the dreadful hired help go. That Mr Mac-Swiney&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019; Mona had a way of making words flat and long so Sergeant Farrat always used his most melodious vowels when he spoke to her. &#x2018;Not too hasty, Mona. There&#x2019;s a fair chance William will be snapped up by one of our eligible spinsters before long.&#x2019; He smiled mischievously. &#x2018;You might find he&#x2019;s busy elsewhere.&#x2019;</p><p>Mona shrank a little sideways and picked at the pilling on her cardigan cuff. &#x2018;Mother sa-ays the girls around here are un-refined.&#x2019;</p><p>Sergeant Farrat looked at Mona&#x2019;s tweed beret sitting on top of her head like a dead cat, her posture laden and graceless. &#x2018;On the contrary, Mona, history has made us all independent, these are progressive times &#x2013; it&#x2019;s an advantage to be adept, especially in the fairer sex&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>Mona giggled at the sex word.</p><p>&#x2018;. . . take for example the Pratt women: they know nuts and bolts and powders that are lethal to maggots in flystruck merinos, also stock feed and the treatment for chicken lice, haberdashery, fruit preservatives and female intimate apparel. Most employable.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;But Mother says it&#x2019;s un-refined &#x2013;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;m aware your mother considers herself very refined.&#x2019;</p><p>He smiled, tipped his cap and entered the shop. Mona dragged a crumpled handkerchief from her cuff, held it to her open mouth and looked about, perplexed.</p><p>Alvin Pratt, his wife Muriel, daughter Gertrude, and Reginald Blood the butcher worked cheerfully, industrious behind their counters. Gertrude tended to groceries and dry goods. She tied every package with string, which she snapped with her bare fingers: a telling skill the sergeant thought. Mrs Muriel Pratt was the expert in haberdashery and hardware. People whispered that she was more suited to hardware. The smallgoods and butchery were in the far back corner of the shop, where Reginald carved and sawed carcasses and forced mince into sheep intestine, then arranged his sausages neatly against circles of trimmed loin chops. Mr Alvin Pratt had a courteous manner, but he was mean. He collected the account dockets from the counter three times a day and filed the debts alphabetically in his glass office. Customers usually turned their backs to him while Gertrude weighed up rolled oats or fetched Aspros, because he would pull files from big wooden drawers and slowly turn the blue-lined pages while they waited.</p><p>...</p></p><h2>Great Teas of China</h2><p><p>The Great Teas of China is the authoritative guide to the extraordinary tea world of China, written by the leading master tea merchant in the United States, Roy Fong.

According to one of the many stories about the origin of this tea, one night, Guan Yin appeared to a farmer in a dream and told him that behind the local Buddhist temple was a treasure to be enjoyed generations if he shared it generously. What he found was a tea plant, and his devotion was rewarded with this uniquely flavored varietal. The word tie (Iron) may refer either to the reddish, oxidized edge of the processed leaf or the dark color of a well-fired leaf. Tie guan yin is known for its thick leaves, full of flavor that mix floral notes with nuttiness and occasionally an exotic peachiness, as well as a lingering, sweet aftertaste. </p></p><h2>Insight Guides Mauritius, Rï¿½union &amp; Seychelles (Travel Guide with Free eBook) (Insight Guides, 267)</h2><p>These three island countries and regions conjure up instant images of white sand beaches, honeymoons, and general luxury travel, but there is so much more to discover in addition.

She is the daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.Sometime around the age of 40, most of us realize that our mothers live deep inside us, proclaims novelist Davis (<i>The</i><i>Long Goodbye</i>) in this series of interviews with more than 20 well-known women of a certain generation&#x2014;Melissa Gilbert, Candice Bergen, Anjelica Huston, Whoopi Goldberg and Cokie Roberts, to name a few&#x2014;about their relationships with their mothers. Some of the mothers led careers as entertainers (like Lorna Luft's mother, [Judy Garland]), activists and preachers, but many were wives, homemakers and divorcï¿½es. The result is a cross between reaffirming self-help book and candid women's narrative, with individual daughters' stories creating a kind of collective memoir. Readers may recognize traces of their own relationships with their mothers as these women recount histories of addiction, sickness and death, along with memories of friendship, strength and reconciliation. Davis interjects to offer uplifting, if boilerplate and unnecessary, interpretations of each woman's journey, but the voices of the daughters, now seasoned with age, contemplation and perspective, are reaffirming in their own right. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tracing previously unexplored narratives from the late eighteenth century to the 1920s, Laurie Maffly-Kipp brings to light an extraordinary trove of sweeping race histories that African Americans wove together out of racial and religious concerns.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Asserting a role in God's plan, black Protestants sought to root their people in both sacred and secular time. A remarkable array of chroniclers&#x2014;men and women, clergy, journalists, shoemakers, teachers, southerners and northerners&#x2014;shared a belief that narrating a usable past offered hope, pride, and the promise of a better future. Combining Christian faith, American patriotism, and racial lineage to create a coherent sense of community, they linked past to present, Africa to America, and the Bible to classical literature. From collected shards of memory and emerging intellectual tools, African Americans fashioned stories that helped to restore meaning and purpose to their lives in the face of relentless oppression. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>In a pioneering work of research and discovery, Maffly-Kipp shows how blacks overcame the accusation that they had no history worth remembering. African American communal histories imagined a rich collective past in order to establish the claim to a rightful and respected place in the American present. Through the transformative power of storytelling, these men and women led their people&#x2014;and indeed, all Americans&#x2014;into a more profound understanding of their interconnectedness and their prospects for a common future.<br></p></p><p>Laurie F. Maffly-Kipp is Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.A seminal work that is destined to become a classic in the field... it is the kind of work that people will be reading... thirty years from now. (Paul Harvey, author of <i>Freedom's Coming: Religious Culture and the Shaping of the South, from the Civil War through the Civil Rights Era</i>)<br><br>This remarkable piece of historical writing allows us to eavesdrop on discussions of fundamental importance to African Americans through the course of the long nineteenth century about the nature of blackness, about divine destiny in history, about the emotional and historical connections between Africa and black America, and about the past as a guide to the future. (Jon Sensbach, author of <i>Rebecca's Revival: Creating Black Christianity in the Atlantic World</i>)<br><br>Laurie Maffly-Kipp's work reveals the rich theological imaginations of vernacular religious thinkers who offered their readers bold histories of the world and religious interpretations of African American peoplehood. A major contribution to the field of African American religious history. (Judith Weisenfeld, Princeton University)<br><br>A challenging analysis of how African Americans understood themselves, challenging because it alters so much of what we take for granted. A deeply human book. (David Hall, Harvard University)<br><br>Maffly-Kipp traces, with great care and originality, the development of African-American collective history and memory from the Revolution into the early twentieth century. She offers a profound reflection on how historical consciousness is formed. (Leigh E. Schmidt, Harvard University)<br><br>Maffly-Kipp draws on lectures, sermons, plays, poetry, and other works of several little-known writers from the American Revolution and WWI that reflect on how the black community in the U.S. has attempted to record and analyze the meaning of the African diasporic experience. She explores the works of free blacks during slavery as they attempted to write their own histories and examine their circumstances as distinct and similar to that of slaves. Among those she examines: Lorenzo Dow Blackson, a self-educated African American Methodist preacher; Jacob Oson, a teacher at an African American school in New Haven, Connecticut, in the 1800s; and George Washington Williams, who in the late 1800s attempted to write the history of the African race. These writers add valuable perspective to the works of better-known black authors and a full perspective on African American history. (Vanessa Bush <i>Booklist</i> 2010-04-01)<br><br>Maffly-Kipp resists simpler analyses that would cast these race histories in unapologetic "heroic" mode or cram them all into the model of "liberatory" texts or (going the opposite direction) decry their tendency to follow European and Protestant models of historical narrative. Instead, she gives a rich and satisfying account of texts in which "race" was only a partial unifier...[An] impressive feat of intellectual history and literary recovery.

A striking proposition of contemporary economics and political science is that it would be an exercise of reason, not a failure of it, not to contribute to a collective project if the contribution is negligible, but to benefit from it nonetheless.</p><p>But Richard Tuck wonders whether this phenomenon of free riding is a timeless aspect of human nature or a recent, historically contingent one. He argues for the latter, showing that the notion would have seemed strange to people in the nineteenth century and earlier and that the concept only became accepted when the idea of perfect competition took hold in economics in the early twentieth century.</p><p>Tuck makes careful distinctions between the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma problem, threshold phenomena such as voting, and free riding. He analyzes the notion of negligibility, and shows some of the logical difficulties in the idea&#x2015;and how the ancient paradox of the sorites illustrates the difficulties.</p><p>Tuck presents a bold challenge to the skeptical account of social cooperation so widely held today.

But that was before Bangkok stole his heart. Now the expat American is happily playing family with Rose, the former go-go dancer he wants to marry, and with Miaow, the wary street child he wants to adopt. Yet just when everything is beginning to work out, trouble comes looking for Poke in the guise of good intentions. First he takes in Miaow's friend, a troubled and terrifying street urchin named Superman. Then he agrees to find a distraught Aussie woman's missing uncle&#x2014;and accept an old woman's generous payment to find a blackmailing theif. Soon, these three seemingly disparate events begin to overlap, pulling Poke deeper into dark, unfamiliar terrain. Gradually he realizes that he's been gliding across the surface of a culture he really doesn't understand&#x2014;and that what he doesn't know is about to hurt him and everyone he loves.</p><p>Beautifully crafted, relentlessly paced, <em>A Nail Through the Heart</em> is an exciting and enticing read that will leave readers hungry for more from the gifted Timothy Hallinan.</p></p><p><p>Timothy Hallinan is the author of nine widely praised books: eight novels&#x2014;including the Bangkok thrillers featuring Poke Rafferty&#x2014;and a work of nonfiction.

Poke Rafferty, a travel writer turned detective, intends to settle down in Bangkok with his ex-prostitute girlfriend, Rose, and a young urchin, Miaow, when Miaow brings her troubled friend Superman into the household. While dealing with this intrusion, Rafferty takes on dual sleuthing assignments to help pay for adopting Miaow. The first case involves finding Australian Claus Ulrich, a hardcore bondage aficionado. When Rafferty meets the powerful and rich Madame Wing while investigating Ulrich's disappearance, she offers him $30,000 to find an envelope and the Cambodian man who took it. The only catch? If Rafferty opens the envelope, he'll learn information about Madame Wing that will force her to kill him. Rafferty stumbles through the clues like the foreigner he is, always on the outside looking in. Despite an overly leisurely ending, the rich depictions of Bangkok's seedy side recall John Burdett's visceral mysteries. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the carnival comes to her own town a few weeks later, Deborah soon discovers there&#39;s nothing ordinary about this rag-tag collection of rides and games. Why does the ride owner&#39;s charm bracelet awaken half-forgotten memories? And what is her connection to Deborah&#39;s own family? When one of the concessionaires is found dead, his mouth stuffed with quarters from his game of chance, Deborah soon learns that he was also chancing a little blackmail on the side -- blackmail that may threaten one of her brothers. In carnie lingo, &#34;A fast dime is better than a slow dollar.&#34; Torn between judicial ethics and family love, Deborah must decide who gets which before more lives are ruined and the carnival moves on.</p><p>You can almost smell the cotton candy and hear the barkers inviting you to try your skill at a game of chance in this lively new mystery starring Colleton County, North Carolina, Judge Deborah Knott. Knott's stunned to discover that Brazos Hartley, murdered on the midway at the Harvest Festival carnival, was a member of her family; his mother, Tally Ames, is Deborah's first cousin, born of a shotgun marriage and abandoned as a child by her father, Deborah's brother. Naturally, when there's a second carnival murder, Deborah can't help getting involved in the investigation, even if it means uncovering secrets some of her relatives would just as soon keep confidential. The huge Knott clan, with Deborah at its center, gives Maron a wealth of material (the judge herself is one of 12 siblings!), which she makes the most of with wonderfully drawn characters and a beautifully evoked setting.

So begins this tale of an unferocious reptile. Most of Derek's time is spent knitting away the afternoons instead of raising a din like his uncivilized siblings, and he wonders if he should be a rough and tumble dinosaur like his brothers. His friend, a mouse, likes him just the way he is. Although these spotted creatures often look more like dragons than dinosaurs, young audiences won't mind. Bold, colorful illustrations on white backgrounds make this story about being different easy to take, and it's nice to see a male character take on what is considered a female hobby and use it to save the day. Unfortunately, the verse is prosaic and the ending flat. Readers will get the most mileage from the bright illustrations and the soulful eyes of the characters. --Denia Lewis Hester, Dewey School, Evanston, IL<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I am the Open Door</h2><p>These spiritual discourses by various Ascended Masters, perfected beings who were once men and women on the earth like us, were dictated at the request of a being known as the Great Divine Director. Unlike most "channeled" books, these beings appeared visibly in their light bodies to give these teachings on how to contact one's own inner God presence, and call it into action through the word, "I AM."&nbsp;<br>May all who feel the radiation of this book - which is that which only Ones Ascended can give - be inspired to apply this&nbsp;spiritual law, and to live according to this law of love.&nbsp;Dictated in 1977, this book of 14 short discourses has since become an international classic.</p><p>Without a doubt, the appearance of these Masters in visible form over a period of ten days was the most powerful and transformative experience of my life. As Godfre Ray King said, "Once you have experienced who these beings are, that is all that you want to become." Their power, majesty and love was beyond description. However, I have tried to describe how this experience took place in my autobiography,&nbsp;<i>Apprentice to the Masters, Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book 2.&nbsp;</i><i></i>When reading the discourses send your attention and love to the particular Master who is speaking, and you will find yourself connected in consciousness. It is to establish that link that these exceptional beings who guide the destiny of humanity came forth at that time.In his struggle to awaken from the dream of materialism, Peter journeyed to the Far East in 1971. In India he spent time with Ram Dass and his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, eventually traveling to the Himalayan foothills to live briefly with Gongotri Baba, a disciple of Babaji. Later he traveled to Tibet and Egypt, but did not find his true path until Sathya Sai Baba guided him to meditate on the "I AM" consciousness. These adventures are described in his book, <i>Search for the Guru, Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book 1.</i>After returning from the East, the Ascended Master known as Saint Germain, materialized before him in Muir Woods, near San Francisco, and told him to go to Mount Shasta. There he would meet the teacher. This was Pearl Dorris, a former assistant to Godfre Ray King author of <i>Unveiled Mysteries</i>. (See Peter's biography of Pearl and her work with the Saint Germain Foundation: <i>Lady Master Pearl, My Teacher).&nbsp;</i>Vowing to accomplish the training that was offered to become Saint Germain's apprentice, he went through years of instruction and experiences with the Masters, who &nbsp; occasionally appeared in physical form.

The music is composed by John Adams.<br>I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky mixes the drama of poetry and song to construct a brilliant earthquake/romance. In the context of the timeless issues of love, the opera, set in South Central Los Angeles, explores such contemporary questions as immigration, birth control, and criminal law. A white cop, a black Baptist minister, and an El Salvadoran mother are among the young Americans cast in this heartfelt portrayal of a day in the life of an LA neighborhood.</p><p>African American poet, essayist, and activist Jordan's libretto for sometime minimalist composer John Adams' latest opera is as timely as this morning's headlines. Since the flashy Peter Sellars is directing the opera's world premier, it may make its own headlines. Adams' earlier operatic successes, <i>Nixon in China</i> and <i>The Death of Klinghoffer</i>, were based on high-profile world events, and Jordan's libretto concerns seven Americans who include such high-profile types as an illegal alien, a reformed gang member, a womanizing preacher, an insensitive white cop, and an overzealous newswoman. Structured as a series of solos and duets, Jordan's work never quite comes together into a single, coherent narrative. But then, that is the point: even before an earthquake shatters their world, her characters live intensely fragmented lives of not so quiet desperation. Libraries that need to collect libretti should not miss this one. <i>Jack Helbig</i></p><h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- Poster Book</h2><p>Published in conjuction with the second live action Harry Potter film, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, this beautiful poster book features high quality images from the upcoming movie.<br><br>This HARRY POTTER POSTER BOOK includes 32 high-quality posters, each featuring a different character or scene from HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS.

Original.</p><p><p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Because my daddy went to work so early, my mother was always the one left with the responsibility of waking me, if I didn't rise and shine on my own for school. She would usually wake me up by making extra noise outside my bedroom door. She rarely knocked and she almost never opened the door. I could probably count on the fingers of one hand how many times my mother had been in my bedroom while I was in it too, especially during the last five years. </p><p> Instead, she would wait for me to leave for school, and then she would enter like a hotel maid after the guests had gone and clean and arrange the room to her liking. I was never neat enough to please her, and when I was younger, if I dared to leave an undergarment on a chair or on the top of the dresser, she would complain vehemently and look like the wicked witch in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> </p><p> "Your things are very private and not for the eyes of others," she would scowl, and put her hands on me and shake me. "Do you understand, Cathy? Do you?" </p><p> I would nod quickly, but what others? I would wonder. My mother didn't like any of my father's friends or business associates and she had no friends of her own. She prized her solitude. No one came to our house for dinner very often, if at all, and certainly no one visited my room or came upstairs, and even if they had, they wouldn't see anything because Mother insisted I keep my door shut at all times. She taught me that from the moment I was able to do it myself. </p><p> Nevertheless, she would be absolutely furious now if I didn't put my soaps and lotions back in the bathroom cabinet, and once, when I had left a pair of my panties on the desk chair, she cut them up and spread the pieces over my pillow to make her point. </p><p> This morning she was especially loud. I heard her put down the pail on the floor roughly, practically slamming it. She was cleaning earlier than usual. The mop hit my door, swept the hard wood floor in the hallway and then hit my door again. I looked at the small clock housed in clear Danish crystal on my night table. The clock was a birthday present from my grandmother, my mother's mother, given only weeks before she had passed away from lung cancer. She was a heavy smoker. My grandfather was twelve years older than she was and died two years later from a heart attack. Like me, my mother had been an only child. Not long ago I found out I wasn't supposed to be, but that's another story, maybe even one that's more horrible than what's happened to me recently. Whatever, one thing was certain: we didn't have much family. Our Thanksgiving turkeys were always small. Mother didn't like leftovers. Daddy muttered that she threw away enough food to feed another family, but he never muttered loud enough for Mother to hear. </p><p> Part of the reason for our small Thanksgivings and Christmas holidays was because my father's parents had nothing to do with him or with us; his sister Agatha and his younger brother Nigel never came to see us either. My father had told me that none of his family members liked anyone else in the family and it was best for all of them to just avoid each other. It would be years before I would find out why. It was like finding pieces to a puzzle and putting them together to create an explanation for confusion. </p><p> When my mother hit the door with the mop again, I knew it was time to rise, but I was stalling. Today was my day at Doctor Marlowe's group therapy session. The other three girls, Misty, Star and Jade, had told their stories and now they wanted to hear mine. I knew they were afraid I wouldn't show up and to them it would be something of a betrayal. They had each been honest to the point of pain and I had listened and heard their most intimate stories. I knew they believed they had earned the right to hear mine, and I wasn't going to disagree with that, but at this very moment, I wasn't sure if I could actually gather enough courage to tell them my tale. </p><p> Mother wasn't very insistent about it. She had been told by other doctors and counselors that it was very important for me to be in therapy, but my mother didn't trust doctors. She was forty-six years old and from what I understood, she had not been to a doctor for more than thirty years. She didn't have to go to a doctor to give birth to me. I had been adopted. I didn't learn that until...until afterward, but it made sense. It was practically the only thing that did. </p><p> My chills finally stopped and I sat up slowly. I had a dark maple dresser with an oval mirror almost directly across from my bed so when I rose in the morning, the first thing I saw was myself. It was always a surprise to see that I had not changed during the night, that my face was still formed the same way (too round and full of baby fat), my eyes were still hazel and my hair was still a dull dark brown. In dreams I had oozed off my bones and dripped into the floor. Only a skeleton remained. I guess that signified my desire to completely disappear. At least that was what Doctor Marlowe suggested at an earlier session. </p><p> I slept in a rather heavy cotton nightgown, even during the summer. Mother wouldn't permit me to own anything flimsy and certainly not anything sheer. Daddy tried to buy me some more feminine nighties and even gave me one for a birthday present once, but my mother accidentally ruined it in the washing machine. I cried about it. </p><p> "Why," she would ask, "does a woman, especially a young girl or an unmarried woman, have to look attractive to go to sleep? It's not a social event. Pretty things aren't important for that; practical things are, and spending money on frilly, silly garments for sleep is a waste. </p><p> "It's also bad for sleep," she insisted, "to stir yourself up with narcissistic thoughts. You shouldn't dwell on your appearance just before you lay down to rest. It fills your head with nasty things," she assured me. </p><p> If my daddy heard her say these things, he would laugh and shake his head, but one look from her would send him fleeing to the safety and the silence of his books and newspapers, many of which she didn't approve. </p><p> When I was a little girl, I would sit and watch her look through magazines and shake her head and take a black magic marker to advertisements she thought were too suggestive or sexy. She was the stern censor, perusing all print materials, checking television programs, and even going through my schoolbooks to be sure nothing provocative was in them. She once cut illustrations out of my science text. Many times she phoned the school and had angry conversations with my teachers. She wrote letters to the administrators. I was always embarrassed about it, but I never dared say so. </p><p> Yawning and stretching as if I were sliding into my body, I finally slipped my feet into my fur-lined leather slippers and went into the bathroom to take a shower. I know I was moving much slower than usual. A part of me didn't want to leave the room, but that was one of the reasons I had been seeing Doctor Marlowe in the first place: my desire to withdraw and become even more of an introvert than I was before...before it all happened or, to be more accurate, before it was all revealed. When you can lie to yourself, you can hide behind a mask and go out into the world. You don't feel as naked nor as exposed. </p><p> I wasn't sure what I would wear today. Since it was my day in the center of the circle, I thought I should look better dressed, although Misty certainly didn't dress up for her day or any day thereafter. Still, I thought I might feel a little better about myself if I did. Unfortunately, my favorite dress was too tight around my shoulders and my chest. The only reason my mother hadn't cut it up for rags was she hadn't seen me in it for some time. What I chose instead was a one-piece, dark-brown cotton dress with an empire waist. It was the newest dress I had and looked the best on me even though my mother de</p></p><h2>A Question of Loyalty: Gen. Billy Mitchell and the Court-Martial That Gripped the Nation</h2><p><p>It had all the ingredients of a movie drama:a scandal that grips Washington and touches the White House; bitter battles and backroom intrigue at the highest levels of the U.S. military; glamorous women who make or break the careers of powerful men; a high-stakes trial with a celebrity defendant who captures the nation's attention ...</p><p><em>A Question of Loyalty</em> plunges into the seven-week Washington trial of Gen. William "Billy" Mitchell, the hero of the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and the man who proved in 1921 that planes could sink a battleship. In 1925 Mitchell was frustrated by the slow pace of aviation development, and he sparked a political firestorm, accusing the army and navy high commands, and by inference the president, of treason and criminal negligence in the way they conducted national defense. He was put on trial for insubordination in a spectacular court-martial that became a national obsession during the Roaring Twenties.</p><p>Douglas Waller has crafted a compelling new biography of the daring Billy Mitchell, a larger-than-life figure remembered as much for his outspokenness as for his innovations in the use of airpower. Waller has uncovered a trove of new letters, diaries, and confidential documents that have enabled him to capture in detail the drama of the court and to build a rich and revealing biography of Mitchell, one of the army's most controversial and flamboyant generals.</p><p>Born to a millionaire Midwest family at the end of the 1870s, Mitchell joined the military at the age of eighteen and became one of its rising stars. During World War I, he led the largest armada of airplanes ever to attack an enemy force and returned to the United States a dashing young general with a chest full of medals and a radical vision of airpower as the only decisive instrument for future wars. But as the military shrank in the postwar years, Mitchell became increasingly impatient and vocal, lashing out at bureaucratic enemies he accused of impeding airpower's progress. After a tragic airship accident that shocked the nation, he publicly blasted the War and Navy Departments for their handling of aviation and was put on trial for it.</p><p><em>A Question of Loyalty</em> is a story about Washington politics, about love and betrayal, about heroes in battle, about determined lawyers and powerful military men pitted against one another in a courtroom.</p></p><p><p>Douglas Waller is a senior correspondent for <em>Time</em>, and before that was with <em>Newsweek</em>. He is the author or coauthor of six previous books, including the national bestseller <em>Big Red</em>, <em>The Commandos</em>, and <em>Air Warriors</em>. He lives in Annandale, Virginia, with his wife and has three children.</p>The 9/11 Commission's final report identifies four broad failures by the U.S. government and intelligence establishment in the years that preceded Sept. 11, 2001. The first of these was a failure of imagination. Leaders both in and out of government failed to imagine the scale of America's vulnerability and the magnitude of the evil that was stalking us in Islamist fundamentalism. The United States had been lulled into a false sense of security. This was remarkably similar to the interwar decades of the 1920s and '30s.<p> In A Question of Loyalty, Douglas Waller tells the timely story of the court-martial of Gen. Billy Mitchell, who publicly attacked his generation of leaders for failing to imagine and fully prepare for the growing threat that could be posed by air power in the hands of a hostile power.</p><p> Often regarded as the father of the U.S. Air Force, Mitchell was a maverick and a visionary who understood the future importance of airpower long before it became a reality. In 1921 he achieved worldwide celebrity by sinking a former German battleship with aerial bombing, an achievement that made onlooking admirals stamp their feet in anger. He famously first predicted the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1923, 18 years before the event. He was also a loud advocate for a Department of Defense and a Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Mitchell's cause cï¿½lï¿½bre was the creation of a separate air force, which was fiercely opposed by the Army and the Navy.</p><p> "The nation victorious in future wars will be the nation commanding the skies," Mitchell argued. "Aircraft will be able to strike at the enemies' nerve centers, to spread panic, cripple industries and collapse governments." This was radical thinking in the early 1920s, when most generals, admirals and politicians doubted the military usefulness of aircraft beyond surveying enemy positions and guiding artillery fire.</p><p> During the '20s there was a yawning generation gap in the military; young officers were frustrated by the failure of their seniors to understand the rapid advances being made in warfare. It was a time when the military bureaucracies had become static, close-minded and deeply resistant to change, very much like the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy today. It was a culture that rewarded "yes" men while sidelining those who spoke up about military deficiencies. This was the era when a reformer like Col. George Patton was passed over for promotion to general because "this officer is a disruptive influence on the peacetime Army."</p><p> Aviators especially resented taking orders from men who knew little or nothing about aircraft or air combat. Mitchell became a hero for the younger generation of officers because he was one of the few officers in the upper ranks who publicly voiced their frustrations. He too was "a disruptive influence," and retribution was sure to come.</p><p>Like many other reformers, Mitchell lacked subtlety. Nor was he without other little imperfections. He was viewed by many as a vain, egotistical, self-publicizing grandstander, and his fiery temperament eventually alienated him from nearly all whom he hoped to influence.</p><p> Frustrated by a lack of progress toward a separate air force and a lack of investment in modern aviation technology, he began openly to criticize the establishment. He was clearly looking for trouble. After the Shenandoah airship disaster that killed 14 men in September 1925, Mitchell accused the War and Navy departments of "incompetency, criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense." This outburst made headlines all over the country and left Mitchell facing a court-martial for insubordination. President Calvin Coolidge and his secretary of war, Dwight Davis, were unimpressed with Mitchell's arguments, which Coolidge viewed as a direct challenge to his authority as commander in chief. It was.</p><p>The high-profile court-martial of the celebrity pilot and World War I hero captivated Washington and the nation. The court proceedings were enlivened by Gen. Douglas MacArthur's presence on the jury and by defense witnesses such as Fiorello LaGuardia and Gen. Hap Arnold. Mitchell's defense depended on the accuracy of his claims that the War and Navy Departments were negligent on pilot safety and national defense. The trial was also a fascinating battle of ideas over the future role of air power. Mitchell, however, played fast and loose with the facts of the Shenandoah disaster, and he exaggerated the immediate threat posed to America by aircraft. He was describing a world almost two decades into the future, a world that was simply beyond the imagination of nearly everybody in the early '20s.</p><p> Among the spurious but damaging evidence presented by the prosecution was the final report of the President's Aircraft Board, which concluded, according to Waller, that "the nations of Europe may have to build large armies and air forces to protect themselves, but vast oceans 'freed' the United States 'from the heavy burden of armament.' " The War Department had little trouble finding enemies to testify against Mitchell, many of whom had a score to settle.</p><p> In the end there was not much defense against the charge of insubordination. A constitutional democracy could not tolerate a challenge to military and civilian authority as harsh as Mitchell's. "In accordance with the army code," Arnold wrote many years later, "Billy had had it coming." Mitchell was suspended from Army service for five years. The court was lenient because of his war record.</p><p> Institutional mavericks, whistle-blowers and critics who press for reform have a tendency to be abrasive, outspoken and hard to get along with. Mitchell was all of these. But much of what he said came to pass, and, as a result, his reputation grew. The realities of Blitzkrieg, Pearl Harbor and the destruction of entire cities with bombs dropped from aircraft cemented his reputation as a true visionary. Such "Mitchellites" as Marshall, Eisenhower, Patton, Spaatz and Arnold went on to become the great army leaders of World War II, putting Mitchell's theories into practice. Most were validated, including the decisiveness of air superiority over the battlefield on land and sea and the value of close air support to ground forces. Others proved off the mark, like the inability of surface ships to survive air attack. Still others, like the value of strategic bombing of cities, remain controversial to this day.</p><p> As Congress debates intelligence reform, this fascinating book reminds us of Harry Truman's dictum that the only thing new in the world is the history you don't know. </p><p>Reviewed by John Lehman <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Tour.</p><p>ying...Impressive...A challenging esay that justifies the feminist revival."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES<br>Bestselling author and feminist scholar Marilyn French has written a shocking and fascinating analysis of the history of women's political, cultural, physical, and economic repression that is as controversial as it is utterly convincing. In this stunning work of resarch, Ms. French creates a devastating portrait of today's male-dominated global society, with its underlying aim of destroying, subjugating, or mutilating women. Here is a devastating indictment of our values and an important step toward an urgent public discussion of human morality.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>French takes on global sexism from the fall of the ancient goddess-worshiping societies to routine modern-day oppression of women in every nation of the world--quite a large bite to chew, and not always thoroughly masticated. ``Humans are the only species in which one sex consistently preys upon the other,'' French proclaims in this determined attempt to sound an alarm to women around the world. ``Men's need to dominate women may be based in their own sense of marginality or emptiness; we do not know its root, and men are making no effort to discover it. But men's long-standing war against women is now, in reaction to women's movements across the world, taking on a new ferocity, new urgency, and new veneers.'' Dating the birth of male insecurity to a decrease in dependence on hunting in ancient matriarchal societies (which, French claims, led to defensive efforts to dominate women and nature through hunting cults, male initiation rites, male deities, and, eventually, the state- sanctioned ``ownership'' of women's bodies), the author asserts that today's nations continue to wage war against women: systemically, through organized religion and international economic policies that fail to value unpaid but indispensable ``women's work''; institutionally, in medicine, science, and law; culturally, via sexist language, advertising, arts, and other media; and individually, through largely unpunished rape, wife-beating, sexual harassment, and incest. French's passion, though otherwise somewhat reminiscent of Susan Faludi's Backlash (1991), is seriously undermined by her overambitious attempt to investigate sexism in every society at once--as well as by undocumented, sweeping accusations (``all male violence toward women is part of a concerted campaign'') and unchecked hyperbole (``Since patriarchy began, prostitution is the only work for which men pay women enough to support themselves'') that obscure the many facts that French reveals once her anger abates. A feminist call to arms--headstrong and provocative. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He's Immortal. </b> <br><br> If there is one thing Dixie LePage does not need in her life, it's complications. And the man sitting across the table from her in a crowded English pub, the one offering to buy the library of her inherited estate in a small English village, is a major complication. For starters, there's the broad shoulders. The slightly amused smirk. That smoldering look that makes it impossible to concentrate. And that infuriating, old-fashioned, and well, okay, incredibly appealing sense of chivalry. No doubt about it, the guy is hot and sexy. Of course, there is one wee little problem: He claims to be a vampire named Christopher Marlowe, as in THE Christopher Marlowe, famous playwright, contemporary of Will Shakespeare. Right. Amend that to hot, sexy, and totally insane. Please see "no more complications." So why can't Dixie seem to resist the warmth of Christopher's charm, the protective feel of his strong hands, or the tempting pull of his full mouth when the sun goes down. . .? <br><br> <b>Love Me Forever<br><br> Does This Come In My Size?</b><br><br> Justin Corvus.

She hadn't counted on the shop assistant being a stylish super-hunk with the kind of Hugh Grant accent that makes a woman's thoughts wander through a neighborhood called Take Me Now, Please. And to top it off, the man's a sweetheart. The way he picked up on the fact that she didn't have two red cents for the Halloween costume Sam wanted but made it happen anyway? Total head-over-heels time. When Justin smiles at her, it's as if he's known her forever. . .and when he asks for her phone number--to let her know when the costume is ready, of course--Stella can't help wanting this feeling to go on forever.

Yet, in the United States, freedom of movement has historically been a right reserved for whites. In this book, Elizabeth Stordeur Pryor shows that African Americans fought obstructions to their mobility over 100 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus. These were "colored travelers," activists who relied on steamships, stagecoaches, and railroads to expand their networks and to fight slavery and racism. They refused to ride in "Jim Crow" railroad cars, fought for the right to hold a U.S. passport (and citizenship), and during their transatlantic voyages, demonstrated their radical abolitionism. By focusing on the myriad strategies of black protest, including the assertions of gendered freedom and citizenship, this book tells the story of how the basic act of traveling emerged as a front line in the battle for African American equal rights before the Civil War.<br><br>Drawing on exhaustive research from U.S. and British newspapers, journals, narratives, and letters, as well as firsthand accounts of such figures as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and William Wells Brown, Pryor illustrates how, in the quest for citizenship, colored travelers constructed ideas about respectability and challenged racist ideologies that made black mobility a crime.<br><br></p><p>Elizabeth Stordeur Pryor is assistant professor of history at Smith College.In this provocative book, Pryor effectively argues that black Americans, understanding that mobility was essential to citizenship, developed and implemented a host of strategies to resist what would be called Jim Crow on stagecoaches, streetcars, railroads, and transatlantic ships. The evidence from the press and archives is rich, enabling readers to know celebrated figures in new ways and to also meet a host of new figures whose dramatic lives and travels have been impressively reconstructed first in this work. This book's boldness--combined with its deep immersion in sources--is very rare.--David Roediger, University of Kansas<br>There is a lot of published scholarship that discusses the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century travel of African Americans, but <i>Colored Travelers</i> is original in that it examines <i>travel itself</i> as a critical site of contestation over antebellum civil rights. If the freedom of mobility is a defining characteristic of social citizenship, Pryor argues, then the formal segregation of space on and in vehicles of transportation&#x2014;coaches, trains, boats&#x2014;constituted the earliest institutionalization of policies and practices of racial segregation in the United States and, thus, transformed these spaces into hotbeds for civil rights activism. These are important arguments, and they have never been so thoughtfully and persuasively made.--Joanne Pope Melish, author of <i>Disowning Slavery: Gradual Emancipation and Race in New England, 1780-1860</i><br><br></p><h2>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - Photostory</h2><p>Khan, the leader of a group of genetically superior humans, plans revenge against the man responsible for his long exile, Admiral Kirk</p><p></p><h2>Exiles</h2><p>This 3-act play was first published in 1918; and like much of Joyce's other works, it is an imaginative reconstruction of his own life. In it, Richard Rowan, an Irish writer who has spent much time abroad, feels estranged from Irish society when he returns to Dublin.&nbsp;</p><p>James Joyce, the twentieth century&#39;s most influential novelist, was born in Dublin on February 2, 1882. The oldest of ten children, he grew up in a family that went from prosperity to penury because of his father&#39;s wastrel behavior. After receiving a rigorous Jesuit education, twenty-year-old Joyce renounced his Catholicism and left Dublin in 1902 to spend most of his life as a writer in exile in Paris, Trieste, Rome, and Zurich. On one trip back to Ireland, he fell in love with the now famous Nora Barnacle on June 16, the day he later chose as &#34;Bloomsday&#34; in his novel &#34;Ulysses. &#34;Nara was an uneducated Galway girl who became his lifelong companion an the mother of his two children. In debt and drinking heavily, Joyce lived for thirty-six years on the Continent, supporting himself first by teaching jobs, then trough the patronage of Mrs. Harold McCormick (Edith Rockerfeller) and the English feminist and editor Harriet Shaw Weaver. His writings include &#34;Chamber music &#34;(1907), &#34;Dubliners &#34;(1914), &#34;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man &#34;(1916), &#34;Exiles &#34;(1918), &#34;Ulysses &#34;(1922), &#34;Poems Penyeach &#34;(1927), &#34;Finnegans Wake &#34;(1939), and an early draft of &#34;A Portrait of a Young Man, Stephan Hero &#34;(1944). &#34;Ulysses &#34;required seven years to complete, and his masterpiece, &#34;Finnegans Wake, &#34;took seventeen. Both works revolutionized the form, structure, and content of the novel. Joyce died in Zurich in 1941.</p><h2>Alexander Pope: The Poet and the Landscape</h2><p>This work provides a look at Pope&#39;s relationship with the leading garden makers of his time. Forever planning and plotting for his own grotto and for his modest five acres in Twickenham, his ideas were also sought at many of the great estates. His importance to Lord Burlington at Chiswick, Henrietta Howard at Marble Hill, and, above all, to William Kent, the great designer is made abundantly clear. The author sets out to throw new light on her subject and show why Pope has been, and remains, so crucial to our landscape.</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Dictionary of Local and Family History</h2><p>With the increasing interest in family history, this portable and authoritative dictionary provides both amateur and professional local history and family historians with quick answers to questions of terminology that may arise in the course of research.

In Her Own Words...<p>"I decided to be a writer at the age of eight, but I did not receive any encouragement in this ambition until thirty years later. I think this ambition was fired-or perhaps exacerbated is a better word-by early marginal contacts with the Great, when we were evacuated to the English Lakes during the war. The house we were in had belonged to Ruskin's secretary and had also been the home of the children in the books of Arthur Ransome. One day, finding I had no paper to draw on, I stole from the attic a stack of exquisite flower-drawings, almost certainly by Ruskin himself, and proceeded to rub them out. I was punished for this. Soon after, we children offended Arthur Ransome by making a noise on the shore beside his houseboat. He complained. So likewise did Beatrix Potter, who lived nearby. It struck me then that the Great were remarkably touchy and unpleasant (even if, in Ruskin's case, it was posthumous), and I thought I would like to be the same, without the unpleasantness.</p><p>"I started writing children's books when we moved to a village in Essex where there were almost no books. The main activities there were hand-weaving, hand-making pottery, and singing madrigals, for none of which I had either taste or talent. So, in intervals between trying to haunt the church and sitting on roofs hoping to learn to fly, I wrote enormous epic adventure stories which I read to my sisters instead of the real books we did not have. This writing was stopped, though, when it was decided I must be coached to go to University. A local philosopher was engaged to teach me Greek and philosophy in exchange for a dollhouse (my family never did things normally), and I eventually got a place at Oxford.</p><p>"At this stage, despite attending lectures by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, I did not expect to be writing fantasy. But that was what I started to write when I was married and had children of my own. It was what they liked best. But small children do not allow you the use of your brain. They used to jump on my feet to stop me thinking. And I had not realized how much I needed to teach myself about writing. I took years to learn, and it was not until my youngest child began school that I was able to produce a book which a publisher did not send straight back.</p><p>"As soon as my books began to be published, they started coming true. Fantastic things that I thought I had made up keep happening to me. The most spectacular was<i> Drowned Ammet</i>. The first time I went on a boat after writing that book, an island grew up out of the sea and stranded us. This sort of thing, combined with the fact that I have a travel jinx, means that my life is never dull."</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is the author of many highly praised books for young readers, as well as three plays for children and a novel for adults.

Originally from Liverpool, England, Jones splits her time between San Diego, California, and Saratoga Springs, New York.The Story So Far When he was seventeen, Raif Sevrance of Clan Blackhail developed the ability to&nbsp; heart- kill game. One morning while he was hunting in the Badlands with his brother Drey, his father and chief&nbsp; were slain back at camp. When he and his brother returned to Blackhail they found that Mace Blackhail, the chief&#x2019;s foster son, had declared himself head of the clan. Mace blamed the murders on Vaylo Bludd, chief of a rival clan. When Bludd sacked the Dhoone house of rival clan Dhoone a week later, Mace&#x2019;s story of Bludd aggression gained credibility. Raif found himself isolated. He alone believed that Mace Blackhail was a liar and a chief- killer. <br>War against clan Bludd followed, as Hailsmen sought to avenge their chief&#x2019;s death. When Mace received word that a caravan of Bluddsmen were on the road, heading east to occupy the Dhoonehouse, he ordered an attack. Raif rode with the ambush party. When he discovered the caravan contained women and children, not warriors, he refused to participate in the slaughter. For disobeying an order on the field and deï¿½serting his fellow clansmen in battle, Raif was branded a traitor to his clan. Four days later, Raif left Blackhail in the company of his uncle Angus Lok. His oath to protect Blackhail was now broken, even while he had sought to act with faith and loyalty. <br>The two men headed south. Upon arrival at Duff&#x2019;s stove house, they learned news of the massacre on the Bluddroad had preceded them. When challenged by a group of Bludd warriors, Raif admitted to being present during the slaughter. He told no one that he took no part in the massacre; loyalty to his clan prevented him from defending himself at their expense. With this admission, however, Raif forever damned himï¿½self in the eyes of Bluddsmen. He was the only Hailsmen they knew for a certainty who was present during the slaughter. <br>When Angus and Raif arrived at the city Spire Vanis they rescued a young woman named Ash March who was being hunted down by the city&#x2019;s Protector General, Mara.ce Eye. Angus had a strong reaction when he saw the girl and immediately put himself in danger to save her. Raif&#x2019;s skill with a bow proved invaluable. He&nbsp; single- handedly rescued the girl by shooting arrows through her pursuers&#x2019; hearts. <br>As Raif, Ash and Angus headed north to the city of Ille Glaive, Raif learned that Ash was the foster daughter of the Surlord of Spire Vanis. She had run away when she learned that her foster father intended to imprison her in the city&#x2019;s citadel, the Inverted Spire. Heritas Cant, a friend of Angus Lok&#x2019;s, provided the explanation for the Surlord&#x2019;s beï¿½havior. Cant told Ash she was the first Reach to be born in a thousand years. She alone possessed the ability to unlock the Blind, the prison without a key that contained the destructive might of the immortal End-lords. Cant warned Ash she must discharge her&nbsp; Reach- power or die. <br>Raif and Angus agreed to accompany Ash to the Cavern of Black Ice, the one place where she could discharge her power without tearing a hole in the Blindwall that holds back the Endlords. As soon as their small party reentered the clanholds they&nbsp; were captured by Bluddsmen. The Bludd chief had lost seventeen grandchildren on the Bluddroad, and he was determined to make Raif Sevrance pay for those losses. After days of torture, Raif developed a fever and began to fail. Yet when Death came to take him she changed her mind. &#x201c;Perhaps I won&#x2019;t take you yet,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;You fight in my image and live in my shadow, and if I leave you where you are you&#x2019;ll provide much fresh meat for my chilï¿½dren. Kill an army for me, Raif Sevrance. Any less and I just might call you back.&#x201d; <br>The next day Raif was saved by a group of Hailish warriors led by his brother Drey. &#x201c;We part here. For always,&#x201d; Drey said as he let his younger brother, the traitor, slip away. <br>Later that day Raif met up with Ash, who had escaped from Marafice Eye by using her&nbsp; Reach- power. The Dog Lord had handed her over to Eye in repayment for a debt. Penthero Iss, the Surlord of Spire Vanis, had aided Vaylo&#x2019;s taking of the Dhoonehouse, and Vaylo had come to regret Iss&#x2019; sorcerous help. Ash March was payment in full. <br>Ash&#x2019;s health deteriorated during the journey to the cavern. When she collapsed in the snow, Raif drew a guide circle and called on the Stone Gods for help. Two members of the ancient Sull people, Far Riders named Mal Naysayer and Ark Veinsplitter, heard this call, and rode to Ash&#x2019;s aid. Upon seeing her, they suspected that Ash was the Reach. They also suspected that Raif was Mor Drakka, Watcher of the Dead; the one predicted to destroy the Sull. <br>The Far Riders took Ash and Raif to a frozen river that led to the Cavern of Black Ice and then departed. Ash discharged her power, but it was already too late. By blasting Marafice Eye&#x2019;s men in the Bitter Hills, she had caused a rent in the Blindwall. Back in her home city of Spire Vanis, a nameless sorcerer who had been enslaved by her foster father was already working to open the breach. &#x201c;Push and we will give you your name,&#x201d; the Endlords promised him. Bound by chains, broken and tortured, the sorcerer accepted the deal. &#x201c;Baralis,&#x201d; the Endlords named the sorcerer as he broke open the wall. <br>Meanwhile the clan wars were escalating. Blackhail waged war on Bludd to avenge the killing of the Hail chief; Bludd fought Blackhail for the slaying of its women and children; and Dhoone, dispossessed of its round house by Bludd, fought to regain its territory. With the help of his&nbsp; half- brother Bram, Robbie Dun Dhoone claimed the Dhoone chiefship and retook Dhoone from the Dog Lord. Due to the desertion of his second son, Pengo, the Dog Lord had been holding the Dhooneï¿½house with a skeleton force. He, his remaining two grandchildren and his lady Nan escaped and headed north toward an old hillfort where his fostered&nbsp; son- Cluff Drybannock was stationed with two hundred men. <br>In order to secure sufficient manpower to retake Dhoone, Robbie sold his brother to the Milk chief, Wrayan Castlemilk, forcing Bram to leave his clan. Bram was made welcome at Castlemilk, but his taste for intrigue&#x2014; acquired in negotiations with Skinner Dhoone and the Dog Lord&#x2014; made him break his oath and join the Phage, a shadowy brothï¿½erhood that aimed to defend the world against the Endlords. <br>Blackhail took possession of Ganmiddich, but lost it when an army led by Marafice Eye broke the Crab Gate that protected it. When news of Penthero Iss&#x2019; death reached the battlefield, half of Eye&#x2019;s forces fied the field to rush back to Spire Vanis and vie for power, leaving Eye at the mercy of a&nbsp; newly- arrived army led by Pengo Bluddfi Bludd took Ganmiddich. Marafice Eye led his injured&nbsp; army&#x2014; plus four hostages taken from Blackhail&#x2014; home to Spire Vanis where his&nbsp; father- in- law Roland Stornoway was holding power on his behalffi With Stornoway&#x2019;s support, Eye became surlord. <br>Back at Blackhail, the slain chief&#x2019;s widow, Raina Blackhail, strugï¿½gled to come to terms with her new life. Like Raif, she suspected that Mace, her foster son, was responsible for her husband&#x2019;s murder, and she did not support his chiefship. After her husband&#x2019;s murder, Mace raped her in the Oldwood and then told clansmen it was consensual. Raina married him rather than risk her reputation and status, becoming chief&#x2019;s wife for the second time. While Mace was away at war with Bludd and Dhoone, Raina quietly began to claim power. When Stannig Beade arrived from Scarpe to replace Blackhail&#x2019;s guide who had been killed in the explosion of the Hailstone, Raina suspected he had been sent to watch her. Tension ran high as Beade began acting as chief. When Anwyn Bird, Raina&#x2019;s oldest friend, was assassinated in cold blood it was the final straw. Guessing that Anwyn had been murdered to siï¿½lence dissension, and fearing for her own life, Raina Blackhail did the only thing she could to protect her clan. She entered the chief&#x2019;s chamber one night and killed Stannig Beade. <br>After departing Blackhail, Angus Lok returned to his home east of Ille Glaive. Upon arrival he found his worst nightmare had come to life: His&nbsp; house had been burned down. His three daughters and his wife&nbsp; were gone. Dead. Angus was a ranger, a member of the Phage. He blamed himself for leading evil to his door. <br>Ash and Raif, once they left the Cavern of Black Ice, headed north into Ice Trapper territory. Ash left Raif while he slept, departing in the company of Mal Naysayer and Ark Veinsplitter. She chose to have her blood drained, a ritual cleansing that would allow her to become Sull. When she and the Far Riders&nbsp; were attacked by Unmade forces at Floatï¿½ing Bridge, Veinsplitter was killed and Ash became separated from the Naysayer. As she traveled alone in Sull territory she met a stranger named Lan Fallstar who told her he would take her to the Heart of the Sull. They became lovers, but he betrayed her, leading her into a trap. Knowï¿½ing that she was a Reach, Fallstar wanted only to harness the power of her body to kill the Unmade. The Naysayer found Ash just in time to save her from Fallstar&#x2019;s assassins, and together they headed south to the Heart of Sull. <br>Raif joined the Maimed Men, an outlaw clan who lived in the cliffs above the&nbsp; Rift&#x2014; the deep cleft in the earth&#x2019;s crust through which the Unmade sometimes escaped to attack mortal men. Traggis Mole, the leader of the Maimed Men, sent Raif to raid Blackhail as a test of Raif&#x2019;s loyalty to the Maimed Men. As the raid party left the mine known as Black Hole, Raif was challenged by his old friend and clansï¿½men Bitty Shank. Raif killed Bitty to escape, and then .ed into the Great Want, the waste at the center of the continent. He was lost for a time. <br>Meanwhile, Ef.e Sevrance, Raif&#x2019;s&nbsp; nine- year- old sister, had been forced to leave her clan. Ef.e had been born to the stone lore and was able to tell when bad things&nbsp; were about to happen. She was an unwitï¿½ting witness when Raina was raped by Mace, and Raina feared this knowledge made Ef.e vulnerable. Seeking to remove the girl from Mace&#x2019;s sights, Raina sent Ef.e to Clan Dregg. Ef.e never made it. She was kidnapped by boatmen from cursed Clan Gray. On the journey to Clan Gray she met Chedd Lime house, who had also been kidnapped, and fell into the Wolf River, where a pike snapped the stone lore from around her throat. <br>Raif was found in the Great Want by the lamb brothers, who&nbsp; were there searching for the souls of their undead. They told Raif about a battle thousands of years earlier where their people and many others had died. One warrior had turned the course of the battle, a man known only as Raven Lord, who wielded the sword named Loss. Legend held that after the battle, the .eld was .ooded and all the dead, including Raven Lord,&nbsp; were frozen beneath the ice. When Traggis Mole was atï¿½tacked by Unmade and lay dying, he forced Raif to speak an oath to proï¿½tect the Maimed Men. Soon after, Raif left the Rift to search for the frozen battle.eld and the sword. Strikes by the Unmade were becoming more frequent and powerful and there&nbsp; were some creatures in the Blind that could only be slain by the Raven Lord&#x2019;s sword. <br>Raif found the sword, and a moment later an old injury to his chest stopped his heart. His old friend, Addie Gunn, and the lamb brothers saved him. He awoke several days later to find himself in possession of the sword named Loss. <br>Excerpted from Watcher of the Dead by J. V.

Despite the odds against them, the WB and UPN went on to alter the landscape of primetime television, only to then merge as the CW network in 2006&#x2014;each a casualty of conflicting personalities, relentless competition, and a basic failure to anticipate the future of the entertainment business.</p><p>Unfolding amid this backdrop of high-stakes business ventures, fanatical creative struggles, and corporate power plays, <em>Season Finale</em> traces the parallel stories of the WB and UPN from their prosperous beginnings to their precipitous demise. Following the big money, big egos, and big risks of network television, Susanne Daniels, a television executive with the WB for most of its life, and Cynthia Littleton, a longtime television reporter for <em>Variety</em>, expose the difficult reality of trying to launch not one but two traditional broadcast networks at the moment when cable television and the Internet were ending the dominance of network television.</p><p>Through in-depth reportage and firsthand accounts, Daniels and Littleton expertly re-create the creative and business climate that gave birth to the WB and UPN, illustrating how the race to find suitable programming spawned a heated rivalry between the two but also created shows that became icons of American youth culture. Offering insider stories and never-before-published details about shows such as <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>Dawson's Creek</em>, <em>7th Heaven</em>, <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, <em>Smallville</em>, <em>Felicity</em>, <em>Girlfriends</em>, <em>Everybody Hates Chris</em>, and <em>America's Next Top Model</em>, Daniels and Littleton provide an exhaustive account of the two creative teams that ushered these groundbreaking programs into the hearts, minds, and living rooms of Americans across the country.</p><p>But in spite of these successes, the WB and UPN unraveled, and here the authors elucidate the corporate miscalculations that led to their undoing, examining the management missteps and industry upheaval that brought about their rapid decline and the surprising teamwork that united them as the CW. The result is a cautionary and compelling entertainment saga that skillfully captures a precarious moment in television history, when the dramatic transformation of the broadcast networks signaled an inevitable shift for all pop culture.</p></p><p><p>Susanne Daniels is the president of entertainment for Lifetime Networks; she was formerly president of entertainment at the WB Network.</p><br><br><p>Cynthia Littleton is the deputy editor of news development for <em>Variety</em>. Both women live in Los Angeles.</p>This predictable look at the "unpredictable business" of television tells the tale of upstart networks the WB and UPN, whose eventual failures were both "symptom" and "byproduct" of "an industry in transition" amid "a broader business environment gone bananas." A former executive at the WB, Daniels recounts the 11-year history of the "netlet" and its main competitor, UPN, in exacting detail. Daniels and her co-writer Littleton (of Variety magazine) bring what gossip they have-noting, for instance, that Katie Holmes nearly passed on Dawson's Creek for the lead in her high school musical-but the majority of the writing is strictly business. Unfortunately, neither Daniels nor Littleton have the knack for developing characters; the majority of the large cast (listed helpfully up front) are introduced with lazy cliches (screenwriter Kevin Williamson "was all youthful exuberance that day, sporting a sweet grin, tousled sandy blonde hair and deep-blue eyes"), drawing life from behind-the-scenes discussion of deals, partnerships, creative development and ratings wars. This chronicle should appeal to future network executives, but fans will probably be happier watching Buffy reruns-or even Star Trek: Voyager. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her bold modernist designs span a wide range of scale and budget--from single-family residences to affordable multifamily housing; from commercial and civic projects to health care facilities. In minimalist, light-filled, sculptural buildings, she puts invention to the service of community, not architectural theory.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fougeron works at the intersection of conflicting forces: old and new; public and private; rough and refined; urban and natural beauty. This tension animates her architecture, inspiring a humane modernism that investigates cultural oppositions. Her aim is not facile harmony of space and structure. She directly engages design with complex social and political questions of the 21st century to fill gaps, heal inequities, and enhance modern life.</p><p>I'm obsessed with architecture. Like most obsessions, mine is driven by passion: the love and awe I've always felt for great buildings, old and new and anywhere in between. I'm also driven by the pleasure I have in designing them, in being immersed in the creative process and emerging in the end with a work that serves the greater good.<br> &nbsp;San Fransisco-based architect Anne Fougeron, principal of award-winning Fougeron Architecture, embraces architectural opportunities found in opposition, creating buildings that redefine program, reinvent historical building types, and reinvigorate civic centers. Each project is a careful consideration of context, light, and structure.&nbsp;<br> <br> Believing that thoughtful architecture should be accessible to all, the firm takes on fewer projects in order to develop meaningful relationships with clients and ensure Fougeron's personal involvement in every project rom start to finish. She not only designs for residential and commercial clients but is unwavering in her commitment to serving often-overlooked nonprofit organizations. She continues to work with organizations such as Planned Parenthood, Mercy Housing, and the San Francisco Public Library.&nbsp;<br> <br> <i>Fougeron Architecture: Opposition/ Composition</i> is the first monograph on this heralded firm. Introduced by Hitoshi Abe, the book features fourteen projects that display the breadth of their work.</p><h2>Beading with Pearls: Beautiful Jewelry, Simple Techniques (A Lark Jewelry Book)</h2><p>Pearls have long stood for classic beauty and elegance, and this collection of 30 exquisite projects, the latest in the bestselling <i>Beading with</i> series, continues that time-honored tradition. It features sophisticated and stylish designs by a pool of talented artists, most using simple techniques suitable for beginners. The pieces range from vintage and sentimental to hip, modern, and edgy: the showstopping Bohemia ring features three burgundy pearls set in silver wire, accented with Swarovski crystals. Nefertiti earrings&#x2014;fit for a queen&#x2014;highlight clusters of tiny white rice pearls on wrapped bead loops. A shimmering three-strand necklace includes polished citrines, faceted glass beads, and off-white pearls.&nbsp; Every page is brimming with high-end style!<br></p><p>Essentially, editor Campbell is an aggregator-collaborator, calling on the talents of 19 designers across the country. Here, the subject is pearls, in all conceivable forms and colors, from freshwater and Mabe Majorca to Tahitian, from cream to burgundy and lavender iris. As Campbell points out in her introductory remarks, pearls quickly became the classic signature of Grace Kelly and Jackie Kennedy as well as the more provocative adornments for Josephine Baker, who combined pearl and banana necklaces at strategic places&#x2014;and nowhere else. Much information is relayed about pearls in general, as well as techniques and storage tips, before launching the 30 projects. Separated by level of proficiency&#x2014;beginner, experienced beginner, intermediate&#x2014;the 30 items each are accompanied by color photographs, illustrations (when necessary), extraordinarily clear instructions, and page references to specific techniques (like making your own jump rings). Patterns vary from contemporary and moderne style to baroque; it&#x2019;s as&nbsp;hard to resist a stark-white oversize pearl ring as it is to ignore a luxuriant flapper chain. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>The Victorian garden album</h2><p>&#34;A charming evocation of the Victorian garden in all its glory with over 300 illustrations, 150 in color.&#34; &#34;Richly illustrated...

Rather than retire, the sixty-two-year-old former president, U.S. senator, secretary of state, and Harvard professor was elected by his Massachusetts friends and neighbors to the House of Representatives to throw off the "incubus of Jacksonianism." It was the opening chapter in what was arguably the most remarkable post-presidency in American history.<p> In this engaging biography, historian Joseph Wheelan describes Adams's battles against the House Gag Rule that banished abolition petitions; the removal of Eastern Indian tribes; and the annexation of slave-holding Texas, while recounting his efforts to establish the Smithsonian Institution. As a "man of the whole country," Adams was not bound by political party, yet was reelected to the House eight times before collapsing at his "post of duty" on February 21, 1848, and then dying in the House Speaker's office. His funeral evoked the greatest public outpouring since Benjamin Franklin's death.</p><p><i>Mr. Adams's Last Crusade</i> will enlighten and delight anyone interested in American history.</p></p><p><b>Joseph Wheelan</b>, a former Associated Press reporter and editor, is the author of <i>Invading Mexico: America's Continental Dream</i> and the <i>Mexican War, 1846&#x2013;1848</i>, <i>Jefferson's War: America's First War on Terror, 1801- 1805</i>, and <i>Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Aaron Burr and the Judiciary</i>.

He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p>Twenty-one stories by the winner of last year's Edgar for Best Novel (A Dance at the Slaughterhouse, 1981), demonstrating his versatility, productiveness, and growth as a writer. Though this is Block's third collection (after Like a Lamb to Slaughter and Sometimes They Bite), focusing on tales written after 1984, it includes four pieces published in the 60's in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine. Each Hitchcock yarn concerns murder and packs a final twist but no emotional resonance: practice scales, really, played diligently by a writer learning his craft. The later stories show the development of Block's more mature themes. Three series characters appear in them: Bernie Rhodenbarr, a thief who steals nothing of value and is a veteran of five novels (The Burglar Who Liked Mondrian, etc.); Martin H. Ehrengraf, an attorney whose ruthless methods get his clients (accused murderers) off the hook and who appears only in stories; and popular p.i. Matt Scudder. Rhodenbarr's turn, in ``The Burglar Who Dropped in on Elvis''--a witty puzzler in which the thief is hired to break into and photograph Elvis's sequestered bedroom at Graceland--highlights Block's lighter vein, which has been drying out lately. The two Ehrengraf stories--which show the lawyer crucifying innocents to defend his clients--demonstrate how Block's earlier irony grew into a sharper mordancy. And the two Scudder tales, as well as several others, reflect his more recent concern with ever-darker subjects. ``Answers to Soldier,'' for instance, tells of a hit man who regularly warms up to his intended victims but inevitably reverts to his cruel ways; and ``The Merciful Angel of Death,'' a powerful exploration of compassion, relates Scudder's tracking of a woman who may be sending AIDS victims to a gentle death. A mixed bag ranging from the hack to the sublime--and, for its best work, a must for Block/Scudder fans. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

What could they expect beyond marriage and childbirth in an age where infant and maternal mortality was frequent and contraception unknown? Did anyone marry for love? Could a woman divorce? What rights had the unmarried? What expectations the widowed?<p>An expert on the period, Antonia Fraser brings to life the many and various women she has encountered in her considerable research: governesses, milkmaids, fishwives, nuns, defenders of castles, courtesans, countesses, witches and widows. `Consistently interesting, funny, touching and thought-provoking to read: a fresh angle of vision has given her a fresh view of the private life of the seventeenth century, and she conveys it with skill.' Spectator `A work of great technical assurance... she writes with a consistent warmth, wit, modesty, conviction on a subject which will be a revelation to almost anyone' The Times `A distinguished and graceful book, packed with interesting information' Observer</p></p><p>Drawing from a wondrously deep well of diaries, letters, and papers from 17th-century England, the gifted historian Antonia Fraser gives the image of the "softer sex" a drubbing, plunging readers into the lives of "heiresses and dairy maids, holy women and prostitutes, criminals and educators, widows and witches, midwives and mothers, heroines, courtesans, prophetesses, businesswomen, ladies of the court, and that new breed, the actress." Prophetess Jane Hawkins, called "a witty crafty baggage" by one angry bishop, got around the ironclad law forbidding women to preach by claiming inspiration from God, while Catholic Mary Ward risked her neck repeatedly to found a string of convents and schools for girls on the European continent. Although several good wives of London beat the Lord Mayor in 1649 for his part in trying to arrest five members of Parliament, it's certainly true that most Englishwomen of the time were hemmed in by the whims and fears of men. Wealthy girls were routinely used as chips to bolster family fortunes through marriage, and any old, poor woman unfortunate enough to have "a furred brow, a hairy lip, a squint eye, a squeaking voice or a scolding tongue" lived under suspicion of witchcraft, wrote one contemporary observer. In Fraser's sure hands and supple prose, memorable and execrable historic moments spring to life. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i>&#34;An almost encyclopedic chronicle of women in 17th century England...wives, warriors, heiresses, preachers... alive with anecdote after anecdote.&#34; - New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Marvelous Things Overheard: Poems</h2><p><p><b>A vibrant and eclectic collection from a stunningly mature young poet </b></p><p>"The world&#x2015;the time has come to say it, though the news will not be welcome to everyone&#x2015;has no intention of abandoning enchantment altogether." Roberto Calasso's words in <i>Literature and the Gods</i> remind us that, in an age of reason, of mechanization, of alienation, of rote drudgery, we still seek out the transcendent, the marvelous. Ange Mlinko's luminous fourth collection is both a journey toward and the space of that very enchantment.<br> <i>Marvelous Things Overheard </i>takes its title from a collection of ancient rumors about the lands of the Mediterranean. Mlinko, who lived at the American University of Beirut and traveled to Greece and Cyprus, has penned poems that seesaw between the life lived in those ancient and strife-torn places, and the life imagined through its literature: from <i>The Greek Anthology</i> to the <i>Mu'allaqat</i>. Throughout, Mlinko grapples with the passage of time on two levels: her own aging (alongside the growing up of her children) and the incontrovertible evidence of millennia of human habitation. <br> This is an assured and revealing collection, one that readers will want to seek refuge in again and again.</p></p><p><p><b>Ange Mlinko</b> was born in Philadelphia in 1969. Educated at St. John's College and Brown University, she has lived most of her adult life in New York, and also spent time in Ifrane, Morocco, and Beirut, Lebanon.

They reveal the connections between seemingly unlike things. The poems also posit these as "human" connections, inasmuch as the history of any one of us depends on the history of all of us. . . . Myths, Greek and otherwise, represent attempts to make sense of the senseless through story-telling, to create contexts for the world's otherwise disparate (and uncaring) mess of facts. Mlinko's poetry at once resists and takes part in this anxious embroidery, in the very human need to take each marvelous thing in turn, and try to bind them all together.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Maureen Thorson, Open Letters Monthly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Here are marvels, mysteries, melancholia; here are New World cicadas, Cypriot potatoes, kiddie boats, the Mediterranean; here is a glorious babble of tongues sung through. Mlinko has a mythy, musical mind. A sensuous intelligence threads us through a glittering word-hoard, its mind-shield. Mlinko writes a sumptuous, surprising, highwire poetry. Its neo-Elizabethan dazzle directs us to the core of our lives as animals of and in language, &#x2018;evolving / only toward more feeling.' This book is an astonishment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Maureen N.

Its strength is in the restoration of the body's natural balance. Whenever a part of the body hurts, the natural instinct is to touch it. Do-in draws on the wisdom of the Ancients and directs that instinct into the most effective method of self-healing.<br><br> Hand contact to a healthy area causes neither pain nor unusual sensation. But touching one which is in trouble might cause some discomfort but it automatically restores energy circulation. The improved metabolism and the return of the organism's strength results. The effect on good internal functions is even more remarkable. At the same time: Mental and spiritual energies are heightened. Even beginners are surprised by the experience. From the depths of human history, here then are the healing methods from the ancient Celtic as well as from the old Eastern medicines. Totally independent from outside interventions, Do-in requires no drug or special equipment, but it helps avoid costly, aggravating doctors visits and their potential for harmful side- and aftereffects.<br><br> Do-in teaches a better knowledge of the body, its strengths and its weaknesses. As a body maintenance tool, i.e. to PREVENT the inroads of illnesses, the practice of Do-in is unsurpassed.<br><br> A 90 minute sound cassette of all 112 exercises depicted in the book effectively complements the rejuvenating system. The detailed clear and simple sound instructions permit "Eyes closed Practice", the better to listen to one's inner voice. The results: better receptivity to the greater sense of well-being. The practical information in this book and the cassette, proven and authenticated by 3,000 years of traditional medicines is a simple and safe step-by-step guide for better health.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Bluebeard&#39;s Egg</h2><p>In this acclaimed collection of twelve stories, Margaret Atwood probes the territory of childhood memories and the casual cruelty men and women inflict upon each other and themselves. She looks behind the familiar world of family summers at remote lakes, ordinary lives, and unexpected loves, and she unearths profound truths. A melancholy, teenage love is swept away by a Canadian hurricane, while a tired, middle-aged affection is rekindled by the spectacle of rare Jamaican birds; a potter tries to come to terms with the group of poets who so smother her that she is driven into the arms of her accountant; and, in the title story, the Bluebeard legend is retold as an ironic tale of marital deception. Stark and scathing at times, humorous and compassionate at others, &#34;Bluebeard&#34;&#39;&#34;s Egg&#34; confirms once again Atwood&#39;s reputation as the pre-eminent chronicler of our times.</p><p>The Bookcassetteï¿½ format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Still, Aggie knows that her absent mother loved her once, years ago, and that someone can love her again. When the Children's Aid Society sends her west on an orphan train, her first experiences are not promising. She snaps at would-be parents, declaring that she's not a housemaid out for hire. But at the last stop, Aggie meets the Bradons, an elderly couple with grown children who want another daughter. Their son is a would-be inventor and their daughter fights for the women's suffrage movement. Aggie tries to fit in with this unconventional family but feels as though she is always doing the wrong thing.

This book tells of the many years Lee acted as guide, pilot and entrepreneur to the backwoods camps.</p><p>There is a moment in <i>Bush Pilot Angler</i>, the late Lee Wulff's newly uncovered journal of his flying and fly-fishing off the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland in the '40s and '50s, that should turn all who've ever cast a fly green with envy. Wulff--prophet of catch-and-release, passionate protector of the salmon, accomplished pilot, conservationist, filmmaker, and writer--was searching for an appropriate place to set down near the headwaters of a lake in the northern peninsula of Newfoundland when he spotted "a couple of long, dark rock ledges stretching out from the mouth of the river, and I made a mental note that they would probably be slippery if I waded out on them." He circled for a better look. "As the plane's shadow crossed the ledges, my heart came into my throat. The rock disintegrated into hundreds of fish that scattered in all directions. There were more Atlantic salmon than I had ever seen in one place." He landed, waded in, and caught fish after fish on a single White Wulff of his own creation, letting them off the hook to be hunted again some other time.<p> What a splendid discovery this journal is. Its pages document Wulff's hard work in establishing the remote Canadian salmon and trout fisheries he first saw from the air, his joys on the stream and in the air, his love for the pristine land and its bounty, his uphill battles with native Newfoundlers over concerns about overfishing, and his triumphs--and calamities--in search of memorable fish. These pages also evoke the immense spirit that attended the man who wrote it. </p><p> In one marvelous anecdote from World War II, Wulff takes both George Marshall and Hap Arnold, America's Army and Air Force chiefs of staff, fishing in the rain. The image of Marshall, "knee deep in the river, casting with an intentness that belied his having left a bloodstained Italy only hours before," is, writes Wulff, unforgettable. "I'll be forever grateful that I was with these men that morning on the river in the rain." Wulff, too, was an unforgettable presence. His journal is something serious anglers everywhere should be grateful for, as well. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Born in Alaska, Lee Wulff graduated from Stanford University with a civil engineering degree. His outdoor films were the first to be featured on network television, and he spent ten years as producer for ABC&#39;s American Sportsman series. Author of many books, including Trout on a Fly, he was a longtime advocate of fisheries conservation and the environment. He died in 1991, at the age of 86, after suffering a heart attack while flying his Piper Super Cub.</p><h2>The Wizard of Oz (Young Reading Series 2 Gift Books)</h2><p>An abridged version of the classic story that tells of Dorothy&#39;s miraculous adventures in the land of Oz.</p><p>4 1-hour cassettes<p><strong>Lyman Frank Baum</strong> (1856-1919), born in Chittenango, New York, was a journalist, dramatist, and writer best known for his fantasies about the land of Oz, the first being <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>.

The original edition of Amos Vogel's seminal book, <i>Film as a Subversive Art</i> was first published in 1974, and has been out of print since 1987. According to Vogel--founder of Cinema 16, North America's legendary film society--the book details the "accelerating worldwide trend toward a more liberated cinema, in which subjects and forms hitherto considered unthinkable or forbidden are boldly explored." So ahead of his time was Vogel that the ideas that he penned some 30 years ago are still relevant today, and readily accessible in this classic volume. Accompanied by over 300 rare film stills, <i>Film as a Subversive Art</i> analyzes how aesthetic, sexual and ideological subversives use one of the most powerful art forms of our day to exchange or manipulate our conscious and unconscious, demystify visual taboos, destroy dated cinematic forms, and undermine existing value systems and institutions. This subversion of form, as well as of content, is placed within the context of the contemporary world view of science, philosophy, and modern art, and is illuminated by a detailed examination of over 500 films, including many banned, rarely seen, or never released works.</p><p></p><h2>Drone Warfare: Killing by Remote Control</h2><p><i>Drone Warfare</i> is the first comprehensive analysis of one of the fastest growing&#x2014;and most secretive&#x2014;fronts in global conflict: the rise of robot warfare. In 2000, the Pentagon had fewer than fifty aerial drones; ten years later, it had a fleet of nearly 7,500, and the US Air Force now trains more drone &#x201c;pilots&#x201d; than bomber and fighter pilots combined. Drones are already a $5 billion business in the US alone. The human cost? Drone strikes have killed more than 200 children alone in Pakistan and Yemen.<br><br>CODEPINK and Global Exchange cofounder Medea Benjamin provides the first extensive analysis of who is producing the drones, where they are being used, who controls these unmanned planes, and what are the legal and moral implications of their use. In vivid, readable style, this book also looks at what activists, lawyers, and scientists across the globe are doing to ground these weapons.

Although the current Lectionary has been in use since 1969, its history, purpose, and structure remains relatively unknown to the many who proclaim or hear its readings. The Sunday Lectionary contributes to a theology of proclamation by explaining the principles that underlie the Lectionary&#39;s selection of biblical passages and its patterns of reading distribution that structure the Sundays, feast days, and seasons of the liturgical year.The book is divided into two parts. The first lays the groundwork by surveying the history of the Lectionaries (chapter 1), chronicling the highlights of the Vatican II Lectionary reform (chapter 2), and examining the characteristic traits of the revised Sunday and feast day Lectionary and its ecumenical import (chapter 3). The second part analyzes the Lectionary&#39;s architecture for each of the liturgical seasons (chapters 4-9).Liturgical proclamation breathes life into the ancient inscribed words, transforming them from words into the Word, thus bringing the transforming, nourishing presence of the risen Christ into the world. The Sunday Lectionary not only helps enrich theological conversation but helps pastors, homilists, worship leaders, rectors, cantors, and students of liturgy foster a deeper appreciation of the Lectionary and, through the Lectionary, the liturgy.Normand Bonneau, OMI, ThD, is Associate Professor of New Testament at Saint Paul University in Ottawa, Canada.

It is built for the United States government in a high security "caged" section at the Sikorsky Aircraft plant in Connecticut. It is non-deployable--meaning that it is never used in any operational capacity by the United States Marine Corps, the branch of the military charged with its upkeep.It is used for one thing, and one thing only. And it has no replicas on active duty--and for good reason, for no one but a few highly cleared Marine engineers and executives at Sikorsky can know all of its special features.Paradoxically, for all this secrecy, the VH-60N is without a doubt the most recognized helicopter in the Western world.On air traffic control displays, it is designated "HMX-1," Marine Helicopter Squadron One, and its official radio call-sign is "Nighthawk." But over the years, the helicopter that ferries the President of the United States over short-to-medium distances has come to be known by a simpler name--Marine One.Known as "M1" to those who fly in it, it is rarely observed in flight, and when it is, it is usually in the most demure of circumstances--taking off from the manicured South Lawn of the White House or arriving at Camp David.But not today.Today it roared over the desert, transporting its famous passenger between two remote Air Force bases located in the barren Utah landscape.Captain Shane M. Schofield, USMC, dressed in his full blue dress "A" uniform--white peaked hat; navy-blue coat with gold buttons; medium-blue trousers with red stripe; spit-polished boots; white patent leather belt with matching white holster, inside of which resided an ornamental nickel-plated M9 pistol--stood in the cockpit of the Presidential helicopter, behind its two pilots, peering out through the chopper's reinforced forward windshield.At five-ten, Schofield was lean and muscular, with a handsome narrow face and spiky black hair. And although they were not standard attire for Marines in full dress uniform, he also wore sunglasses--a pair of wraparound antiflash glasses with reflective silver lenses.The glasses covered a pair of prominent vertical scars that cut down across both of Schofield's eyes. They were wounds from a previous mission and the reason for his operational call-sign, "Scarecrow."The flat desert plain stretched out before him, dull yellow against the morning sky. The dusty desert floor rushed by beneath the bow of the speeding helicopter.In the near distance, Schofield saw a low mountain--their destination.A cluster of buildings lay nestled at the base of the rocky hill, at the end of a long concrete runway, their tiny lights just visible in the early light. The main building of the complex appeared to be a large airplane hangar, half-buried in the side of the mountain.It was United States Air Force Special Area (Restricted) 7, the second Air Force base they were to visit that day."Advance Team Two, this is Nighthawk One, we are on final approach to Area 7. Please confirm venue status," the pilot of M1, Marine Colonel Michael "Gunman" Grier said into his helmet mike.There was no reply."I say again, Advance Team Two. Report."Still no reply."It's the jamming system," Grier's copilot, Lieutenant Colonel Michelle Dallas, said. "The radio guys at 8 said to expect it. These bases are all Level-7 classified, so they're covered at all times by a satellite-generated radiosphere. Short-range transmissions only, to stop anybody transmitting information out."Earlier that morning, the President had visited Area 8, a similarly isolated Air Force base about twenty miles to the east of Area 7. There, accompanied by his nine-man Secret Service Detail, he had been taken on a brief tour of the facility, to inspect some new aircraft stationed in its hangars.While he had done so, Schofield and the other thirteen Marines stationed aboard Marine One and its two escort choppers had waited outside, twiddling their thumbs underneath Air Force One, the President's massive Boeing 747.While they waited, some of the Marines had started arguing over why they hadn't been allowed inside the main hangar of Area 8. The general consensus--based solely on wild unsubstantiated gossip--had been that it was because the facility housed some of the Air Force's top-secret new airplanes.One soldier, a big-smiling, loud-talking African-American sergeant named Wendall "Elvis" Haynes, said that he'd heard they had the <i>Aurora</i> in there, the legendary low-orbit spy plane capable of speeds over Mach 9. The current fastest plane in the world, the SR-71 Blackbird, could only reach Mach 3.Others had proffered that a whole squadron of F-44s--ultra-nimble, wedge-shaped fighters based on the flying-wing shape of the B-2 stealth bomber--were stationed there.Others still--perhaps inspired by the launch of a Chinese space shuttle two days previously--suggested that Area 8 housed the X-38, a sleek 747-launched offensive space shuttle. A black project run by the Air Force in association with NASA, the X-38 was reputedly the world's first fight-capable space vehicle, an attack shuttle.Schofield ignored their speculation.He didn't have to guess that Area 8 had something to do with top-secret airplane development, probably space-based. He could tell it from one simple fact.Although the Air Force engineers had concealed it well, the regulation-size black bitumen runway of Area 8 actually <i>extended</i> another thousand yards in both directions--as a pale concrete landing strip hidden beneath a thin layer of sand and carefully placed tumbleweeds.It was an elongated runway, designed to launch and receive aircraft that needed an extra-long landing strip, which meant aircraft like space shuttles or--And then suddenly the President had emerged from the main hangar and they were on the move again.Originally, the Boss had intended to fly to Area 7 on Air Force One. It would be faster than Marine One, even though the distance was short.But there had been a problem on Air Force One. An unexpected leak in the left wing's fuel tank.And so the Boss had taken Marine One--always on stand-by for precisely this situation.Which was why Schofield was now gazing at Area 7, lit up like a Christmas tree in the dim morning light.As he peered at the distant hangar complex, however, Schofield had a strange thought. Curiously, none of his colleagues on HMX-1 knew any stories about Area 7, not even wild unsubstantiated rumors.No one, it seemed, knew what went on at Area 7.<br> Life in the immediate vicinity of the President of the United States was a world unto itself.It was at the same time both thrilling and frightening, Schofield thought.Thrilling because you were so close to one with so much power, and frightening because that man was surrounded by a great number of people who claimed his influence as their own.Indeed, even in his short time on board Marine One, Schofield had observed that at any one time, there were at least three competing power clusters vying for the President's attention.First was the President's own staff, those people--largely self-important Harvard types--whom the President had appointed to aid him on a range of matters: from national security and domestic policy; to the management of the press corps or the management of his political life.No matter what their field of expertise, at least insofar as Schofield could see, each of the President's personal staff seemed to have one all-encompassing goal: to get the President outside, onto the streets, and into the public eye.In direct contrast to this objective--indeed, in direct opposition to it--was the second group vying for the President's ear: his protectors, the United States Secret Service.Led by the stoic, no-nonsense and completely impassive Special Agent Francis X. Cutler, the Presidential Detail was constantly at loggerheads with the White House staff.Cutler--officially known as "Chief of the Detail," but known to the President merely as Frank--was renowned for his coolness under pressure and his complete intransigence to pleas from political ass-kissers. With his narrow gray eyes and matching crew-cut hair, Frank Cutler could stare down any member of the President's staff and rebuff them with a single word, "No."The third and last group pressing for presidential attention was the crew of Marine One itself.Not only were they also subjected to the inflated egos of the presidential staff--Schofield would never forget his first flight on Marine One, when the President's Domestic Policy Adviser, a pompous twenty-nine-year-old lawyer from New York, had ordered Schofield to get him a double latte, and to "make it quick"--they were also often at odds with the Secret Service.Securing the President's safety may have been the job of the Secret Service, but when he was on HMX-1, so the Marine Corps reasoned, the Boss had at least six United States Marines on board with him at any given time.An uneasy truce had been brokered.While on board Marine One, the President's safety would be in Marine hands. As such, only key members of his Secret Service Detail--Frank Cutler and a few others--would fly with him. The rest of his personal Detail would fly in the two chase helicopters.As soon as the President stepped off Marine One, however, his well-being was once again the exclusive responsibility of the United States Secret Service.<br> Gunman Grier spoke into his helmet mike. "Nighthawk Three, this is Nighthawk One. Go and check on Advance Team Two for me. This radiosphere is screwing up our long-range comms. I'm picking up their All-Clear beacon, but I can't get any voice contact. They should be over at the exit vent. And if you get close enough, see if you can raise Area 8 again. Find out what's happening with Air Force One."<i>"Copy that, Nighthawk One,"</i> a voice replied over the short-wave. <i>"On our way."</i>From his position behind Grier and Dallas, Schofield saw the Super Stallion to their right peel away from the group and head off over the desert.The two remaining choppers of Marine Helicopter Squadron-1 continued on their way.<br> In a darkened room somewhere, a blue-uniformed man wearing a radio headset and seated in front of an illuminated computer display spoke quietly into his wraparound microphone."--Initiating primary satellite signal test ... <i>now</i>--"<br> He pressed a button on his console.<br> "What the hell--?" Dallas said, touching her earpiece."What is it?" Gunman Grier asked."I don't know," Dallas said, swiveling in her seat. "I just picked up a spike on the microwave band."She looked at the microwave display screen--it depicted a series of jagged spikes and troughs--then shook her head. "Strange. Looks like an incoming microwave signal just hit us and then bounced away.""Antibugging was done this morning," Grier said. "Twice."Comprehensive sweeps for listening devices planted on Marine One--and her passengers--were done with rigorous regularity. It was nigh on impossible to plant a transmitting or receiving device on the President's helicopter.Dallas peered at her screen, shrugging. "The signal's too small to be a location beacon. Ditto, speech or computer data. It didn't send or take any information--it's as if it was just, well, checking to see if we were here." She turned to Grier questioningly.The Presidential Helicopter Pilot frowned. "Most probably it's just a surge in the radiosphere, a deflected microwave signal. But let's not take any chances." He turned to Schofield. "Captain, if you wouldn't mind, would you please do a sweep of the aircraft with the magic wand."<br> "--Return signal received," the console operator in the darkened room said. "Primary signal test successful. The device is operational. Repeat. <i>The device is operational.</i> Switching back to dormant mode. All right. Commencing test of secondary signal--"<br> Schofield stepped into the main cabin of Marine One, waving a AXS-9 digital spectrum analyzer over the walls, seats, ceiling and floor, searching for anything that was emitting an outgoing signal.As one would expect of the President's helicopter, the interior of M1 was plush. Indeed, with its deep maroon carpet and widely spaced seats, it looked more like the first-class section of a commercial airliner than the hold of a military aircraft.Twelve beige leather seats took up most of the main cabin. Each seat had the Seal of the President of the United States embroidered on it, as did the oversized armrests that adjoined each chair and the scotch glasses and coffee mugs, just in case anyone forgot in whose presence they were traveling.At the rear of the central area, guarded at all times by a Marine in full dress uniform, was a polished mahogany door that led to the aft-most section of the helicopter.It was the President's private office.Small but elegantly appointed--and featuring an amazingly compact arrangement of phones, faxes, computers and televisions--Marine One's office allowed the Boss to monitor the nation's business wherever he happened to be.At the very rear of the President's office, behind a small pressure-sealed door, was one final feature of Marine One which was reserved for use in only themost dire of circumstances--a small one-man ejection unit, the Presidential escape pod.Schofield waved his spectrum analyzer over the seats in the first-class section, searching for bugs.Seated there were Frank Cutler and five of his Secret Service people. They peered out the windows, ignoring Schofield as he did his sweep around them.Also there were a couple of the President's advisers--his Deputy Chief of Staff, his Communications Director--both of whom flicked through thick manila folders.Standing above them, manning the two exit doors at either end of the main cabin, were a pair of straight-backed United States Marines.There was one more person seated in the main cabin.A stocky no-necked man dressed in an olive U.S. Army uniform, sitting quietly at the back of the cabin, in the first-class seat closest to the President's office.To look at him, with his carrot-red hair and bushy orange mustache, he didn't seem like anyone special, and truth be told, he wasn't anyone special.He was an Army warrant officer named Carl Webster, and he followed the President wherever he went--not because of any special expertise or knowledge he possessed, but because of the extremely important object handcuffed to his right wrist: a stainless-steel briefcase that contained the codes and the activation switches to America's nucle...</p><h2>MOT HOSEA JONAH (Mastering the Old Testament)</h2><p><p>General editor Lloyd J.

Even histories of the Great War tend to focus on the Western Front with, perhaps, a look at the massive battles on the Russian Front while declaring the Middle Eastern, African, and Balkan theaters to be mere "sideshows." Distinguished historian Alan Palmer revises this received wisdom in his excellent book <i>Victory 1918</i>.<p> Historians have usually argued that the German Army exhausted itself in its final gambit, a titanic push toward Paris in the late months of 1918. Palmer disagrees, contending that Allied offensives in Italy, Greece, Mesopotamia, and France kicked the props out from under the German Empire in the early months of the war's final year. A comprehensive survey of Allied military and diplomatic actions throughout the war, <i>Victory 1918</i> reveals many global issues that weighed on the minds of British and French war planners. For instance, Field Marshal Earl Kitchner, England's colonial enforcer, squelched a possible jihad throughout India, the Middle East, and Africa by appealing to Mecca's spiritually powerful Sherif Hussein in 1914. This diplomatic coup severely reduced the impact of Sultan Mehmed V's call to arms from Constantinople, meaning Britain could then field more divisions in Flanders. Lucid and entertaining, <i>Victory 1918</i> is a fresh portrait of a conflict that established the political and military contours of the 20th century. <i>--James Highfill</i></p>Alan Palmer was educated at Bancroft&#39;s School, Woodford Green, and at Oriel College, Oxford.

After all, Orville and Wilbur Wright were Dayton, Ohio, boys who went to Kitty Hawk in 1903 to get things off the ground. When space became the next frontier, John Glenn, who was born in Cambridge, Ohio, on July 18, 1921, became the first American to orbit the earth in his Friendship 7 spacecraft. A Wapakoneta, Ohio, resident, Neil Armstrong, born in 1930, followed in the footsteps of Glenn by being the first human to step onto the moon&#x2019;s surface during the summer of 1969. Don Thomas, a Cleveland native, saw other Ohioans in space and set his sights on becoming an astronaut. After years of hard work and dedication, he became part of the 1995 All-Ohio space shuttle Discovery mission. <i>Orbit of Discovery </i>provides a first-hand account of this mission. Written by Thomas with the assistance of journalist, Mike Bartell, the book is a lively and entertaining must read for individuals who want to experience a ride into space. <i>Orbit of Discovery</i> is augmented with a foreword by astronaut and Senator John Glenn and an introduction by Senator George Voinovich.</p><p><b>Don Thomas</b> was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and joined NASA in 1988 as a materials engineer working on the space shuttle program. In 1990, he was selected in NASA&#x2019;s thirteenth group of astronauts. He is a veteran of four space shuttle missions, completing nearly seven hundred orbits of the Earth and traveling over seventeen million miles during his twenty-year career with NASA. Additional information about the STS-70 mission can be found at OhioAstronaut.com. <b>Mike Bartell</b>, a lifelong resident of Toledo, Ohio, covered numerous space shuttle missions during his award-winning thirty-five-year career as a reporter and editor at <i>The Blade </i>in Toledo. He also taught journalism at the University of Toledo for more than thirty years.<br>"Loaded with thirty-two pages of colorful images, including NASA and private crew photographs, Orbit of Discovery is a treasure chest of incredible memories giving the reader an insiders track on what it also took to fly aboard humankind's greatest flying machine ever built." --Charles Atkeison, examiner.com<br></p><h2>Valley of Silence (The Circle Trilogy, Book 3)</h2><p>In this conclusion to &#34;The Circle Trilogy,&#34; one vampire dares to stand against Lilith and her minions, using his love for the newly-crowned queen of Geall to finally complete the circle of six.</p><p>Nora Roberts is the number-one New York Times-bestselling author of more than 150 novels, including Angels Fall, Northern Lights, Blue Smoke, and Chesapeake Blue.

While Andersen&#x2019;s tales continue to seize the imagination with their singular blend of simplicity, eccentricity, and charm, English-language readers have until now had to content themselves with inaccurate retellings and inadequate translations. Diana Crone Frank, a Danish novelist and linguist, and Jeffrey Frank, a novelist and editor at the <i>New Yorker</i>, offer a much-needed modern translation.<p></p><p>In this collection are twenty-two tales that best represent Andersen&#x2019;s literary legacy, including such classics as &#x201c;The Little Mermaid,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Ugly Duckling,&#x201d; &#x201c;Thumbelisa,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes,&#x201d; as well as largely unfamiliar stories like &#x201c;By the Outermost Sea.&#x201d; Illuminating notes clarify references in the tales. And in an introductory essay, the Franks explore the writer and his times, placing the enigmatic and often bizarre figure of Andersen among his literary contemporaries, such as Charles Dickens and Sï¿½ren Kierkegaard, with whom he crossed paths; and they bring to life Andersen&#x2019;s fascinating relationship with the United States. Illustrated with the delicate and beautiful drawings that accompanied the original Danish publication, <i>The Stories of Hans Christian Andersen</i> will delight readers of all ages.<br></p></p><p>&#34;The translation of Andersen&#39;s tales by Diana Crone Frank and Jeffrey Frank is cause for real celebration.

She begins with a brief background of current debates on&nbsp;issues from abortion and the right to die (under the topic&nbsp;&#x201c;Culture Wars&#x201d;)&nbsp;to highway privatization and FEMA (under &#x201c;Homeland Security&#x201d;).This is an essential resource for Americans of whatever political persuasion, including independents, libertarians, progressives, and populists, all of which she defines and explains. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Spiritual Perspectives and Human Facts: A New Translation with Selected Letters (Writings of Frithjof Schuon)</h2><p>This new edition of Frithjof Schuon&#39;s Spiritual Perspectives and Human Facts is a fully revised translation of the French edition, and has an extensive Appendix containing previously unpublished letters and other private writings.</p><p></p><h2>Blackbird: The Life and Times of Paul McCartney</h2><p>Examines the distinct public and private spheres of a man who is about to enter his fourth decade as a superstar musician, yet maintains his status as a devoted husband and father to his family</p><p><b>Geoffrey Giuliano,</b> one of the leading authorities on the Beatles, is the author of <i>Dark Horse: The Life and Art of George ; Behind Blue Eyes: The Life of Pete Townsend; The Lost Beatles Interviews; The Lost John Lennon Interviews;</i> and many other books on rock music and culture.Prince Paul conquers the world as a Beatle, then daringly starts his own group (Wings) and lives forever after in tight- fisted happiness with his Lady Linda--in this vapid gusher from Giuliano (Dark Horse: The Secret Life of George Harrison, 1990). Giuliano begins with a 90-page rehearsal of the Fab Four's career--nothing new here, it's all from familiar and secondary sources. He then turns to the marriage of Linda Eastman and McCartney. Potentially of interest, this union of a son of a cotton factor and a daughter of a Cleveland heiress--but after a run through old fan magazines and previously published interviews, enlivened only by Giuliano's fillips (``Linda McCartney...is today a mature, creative, socially concerned woman with no illusions about either her complicated place in pop history or her role as a responsible, caring citizen of Spaceship Earth''), we know no more than we began with. Giuliano's chief informant, Denny Laine--who played guitar in Wings for several years--does provide some interesting insights. Money: ``McCartney was always making excuses for not paying us properly by saying his money was all tied up in the Beatles' company, Apple...I was kept in the dark all the time about money, just given a check now and again.'' Recording: ``He and Linda did smoke a fantastic amount of stuff by anybody's standards...so much of it makes you very indecisive and takes away your self-confidence. That's why Paul's albums take him ages and ages to make. He just cannot be decisive about anything.'' Laine left the band when McCartney was arrested for drug-possession in Tokyo. In subsequent years, McCartney forbade the band to carry any drugs across the border. This prohibition, says Giuliano, did not apply to McCartney himself; he used the hood on his daughter's coat and his son's diaper as stash bags. For True Believers only.

The Cathars, who were savagely suppressed in the thirteenth century, are the best-known medieval adherents and martyrs of Dualism, but yet behind them we can still glimpse 'one of the most elusive and tenacious heretical sects of the Middle Ages' - the Balkan Bogomils.<br>In this superb piece of scholarly detective work Yuri Stoyanov charts the descent and evolution of Dualism, from the revelations of Zoroaster and the Orphics, via the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Mithraic Mysteries and the great Gnostic teachers, to reconstruct its medieval revival in Europe. His book casts fresh light on some of the most obscure aspects of the history and the teachings of the Bogomils and the Cathars and illuminates unsuspected religious and political undercurrents that lie beneath the surface of official history.</p><p></p><h2>Pretensions to Empire: Notes on the Criminal Folly of the Bush Administration</h2><p><b>The preeminent political essayist writes about the perversion of America's democratic legacy under George W. Bush&#x2014;and makes a compelling case for impeachment.<br><br></b>Lewis Lapham stands virtually alone among mainstream American journalists in having consistently seen through the fog of lies and narcissism surrounding the Bush administration from its earliest days in Washington. <i>Pretensions to Empire</i> brings together Lapham's trenchant political commentaries from his award-winning "Notebook" column in <i>Harper's</i>, giving us a complete picture of a presidency whose brazen abuses of power&#x2014;and incompetence&#x2014;have led the United States down a precipitous path, culminating in Lapham's eloquent case for impeachment.<br><br>From a perspective deeply informed by history, Lapham's essays measure the current political moment against a backdrop of past events. Whether discussing the failure of the Bush administration's imperial project in Iraq, its shameless servitude to the country's corporate and religious minority and equally shameful ineptitude in responding to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, or the disturbing revelations of illegal domestic spying authorized by the president himself, Lapham perceives in George W. Bush and his allies a fundamental betrayal of the nation's democratic heritage.<br><br>Written with the clarity of thought and elegance of prose that have become Lapham's signature style over the years, <i>Pretensions to Empire</i> is a brilliant and provocative work of political reportage.</p><p><b>Lewis Lapham</b> is editor emeritus of <i>Harper's Magazine</i> and one of the country's most respected journalists. A recipient of a National Magazine Award for his essay writing, he is the author of several books, including, most recently, <i>With the Beatles</i>. The New Press has published two of his previous essay collections, <i>Theater of War</i> and <i>30 Satires</i>. He lives in New York City.The well-respected and much-fï¿½ted editor emeritus of <i>Harper's</i> magazine and recipient of a National Magazine Award, Lapham presents a collection of previously published articles that range from the funding of think tanks and propaganda outfits to the rigging of the 2004 election and the response to Hurricane Katrina. Overall, this book is a lament for the state of our society and a bitter condemnation of the Republican hold on power and the machinations with which that grip has been cultivated and sustained. Lapham's dense and self-assured style is rivaled only by that of William F. Buckley Jr. in delivering a whopping dose of sanctimony and affectation with each paragraph. Though more erudite than Ann Coulter or Bill O'Reilly, Lapham's essays are similarly bereft of a sustained line of argument. He also shares their irredeemably dark view of human nature, or at least of Americans, who we learn are "[w]arfaring people, unique in our gift for violence... killing anyone and anything." Above all, he seems to enjoy nothing more than to display his boundless contempt for all those who are not him. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But Cunningham endured the incredible pain and horrible scars; after nearly a year he learned to walk again. He went on to become one of the greatest track stars of all time, and a national hero. &#x201c;The Kansas Flyer&#x201d; set world records in the mile in 1934 and 800m in 1936. A comprehensive biography, with extraordinary depth of detail, fascinating anecdotes, and written with full cooperation and archives from his widow.</p></p><p>Paul J. Kiell is a psychiatrist, a former editor of the American Athletic Association Quarterly, a runner and a swimmer. His work has been published in Running Times and Runner&#39;s World.--PROLOGUE-- FOND MEMORIES OF A GREAT MILER Such was the headline for a letter-to-the-editor published in the New York Times shortly after Glenn Cunningham&#x2019;s death on March 10, 1988. Here is what Bob Corrigan wrote: With the death of Glenn Cunningham on March 10, America lost one of its authentic sports heroes. I am too young to have seen him compete in his heyday, but as a boy I heard the remarkable story of the athlete who overcame severe burns on his legs to become the greatest miler in the world. Cunningham&#x2019;s duels with rivals Bill Bonthron and Gene Venzke in the 1930&#x2019;s made the mile track&#x2019;s glamour event. In recent years I learned about Cunningham&#x2019;s devotion to helping troubled children. For most of his adult life, he and his wife guided thousands of abandoned, abused, and delinquent boys and girls to productive lives. Less than two weeks before his death, I had the opportunity to meet Cunningham, who told me his work with young people had given him far more satisfaction than his athletic achievements. I&#x2019;ll never forget his words: "There is nothing as important as a child." Those of us&#x2014;parents, youth workers, teachers, and others &#x2014;who agree with him can only hope in this era of artificial sports heroes that the Glenn Cunningham story will not be forgotten. <p>&#x2014;Robert J. Corrigan, Jackson Heights, Queens In the nearly two decades since that letter, the mile is still pretty much track&#x2019;s glamour event, while track itself has assumed a less glamorous pose. Bob Corrigan and I met and became friends. A video about Cunningham entitled The Iron Man of Kansas, by a now defunct producer, was made. Bob wrote a book titled Tracking Heroes. In it he chronicled the lives of thirteen trackmen of the past, among them Glenn Cunningham. Glenn&#x2019;s widow, Ruth, became a dear friend of our family. But still, the story of Glenn Cunningham lies fallow, virtually forgotten, yet to be truly told. It is, however, a story that must be told, told in terms of his running but only as this was an extension of the man, reflecting the timeless values he lived by. It is a tale not only of his deeds on and off the track, but of an attitude, a philosophy and a prescience that wears well for all times. That he was an authentic sports hero was determined, in part, by the era of the 1930s, the time of the Great Depression. In Cunningham the public found its idol in a man who had been scarred and suffered a loss through trauma, yet whose person literally and figuratively soared above the ashes. He was exemplar of the American Dream. His work with abandoned, abused, and delinquent boys and girls evolved first from his empathy, augmented by his example&#x2014;a product of his character. From his empiric understanding of animals and his education (he had earned a Ph.D. in biology, health, and physical education) he presaged the practice of animal therapy; his intuition, the biblical scholarship upon which his philosophy of life was based, foretold the science of cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. His was a way of life forged in tragedy yet caressed by love of family and friends. Among the basics that his recovery and evolving outlook were founded upon were a joy in physical activity that was reinforced by a love of animals, with whom he learned to play and to communicate. Such was an extension of his love for family and friends, particularly friends and others along the way to whom life had delivered cruel blows. He always defended anyone beset by a bully. He hated bullies. The story begins in the state of Kansas, a state fittingly bearing the old Roman motto: Ad Astra per Aspera (to the stars through struggle).</p></p><h2>Jean-Jacques Lequeu (French Edition)</h2><p>Trained in the Age of Enlightenment, Lequeu (1757-1826), son of a modest carpenter from Rouen, briefly enjoyed the final years of Anglo-Chinese parks and aristocratic celebrations, before they were swept away by the Revolution. Reduced to a junior office clerk, he uncompromisingly pursued his ambition as an artist. <br><br>His imagination is full of bookish references, such as The Dream of Poliphilus. He dreams of sumptuous monuments, fictitious factories, and imagined landscapes of invention. Beyond architecture, his gallery is enriched by a disturbing series of selfportraits, grimacing figures, erotic paintings and raw anatomical details. <br><br>Six months before his disappearance into destitution and oblivion, he bequeathed his unique and fascinating graphic work to the Bibliothï¿½que Royale in Paris.

That current is best identified by its catch-labels--Theater of the Absurd, Black Comedy, the Theater of Cruelty--which is to say the theater of alienation, of moral anarchy and despair. To the practitioners of those philosophies Man of La Mancha must seem hopelessly naive in its espousal of illusion as man's strongest spiritual need, the most meaningful function of his imagination. But I've no unhappiness about that. "Facts are the enemy of truth," says Cervantes-Don Quixote. And that is precisely what I felt and meant."--Dale Wasserman, from the Preface.<b>Dale Wasserman</b> wrote for theater, television, and film for more than fifty years and is best known for the musical&nbsp;<i>Man of La Mancha,</i> a multiple Tony Award winner.

When her mentor Angela Perkins leaves for the big time in New York, Deanna risks everything for the chance to replace Angela on the air. Finn Riley, the network&#39;s sexiest journalist, falls for the risk-taker in the small town girl.

She is also the author of the bestselling<em>In Death</em>series written under the pen name J.D. Robb. There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.A scheming rival and an obsessive fan convince a TV star that she's a long way from Kansas--in more sudsy romantic suspense from Roberts (Honest Illusions, 1992). Deanna Reynolds and Angela Perkins are both smart, talented, attractive, and ambitious. The big difference between the two talk- show hosts is that Angela is an attention-hungry woman desperate to maintain her fading charms and worshipful audience at all costs, while Dee maintains her Midwestern values even as her Chicago-based show makes her a star and threatens Angela's in New York. Angela, who was once Dee's mentor, has never forgiven the younger woman for turning down her offer to come to New York with her. Even less forgivable is Dee's romance with Finn Riley, a footloose foreign correspondent and once Angela's lover. Finn, who coolly calls in exclusives from a crash-landing 747, shrugs off a bullet wound while he broadcasts live during a shootout, and indisputably earns the nickname ``Desert Hunk'' during the Gulf War, finds his match in the unbelievably beautiful, desirable, and sweet Deanna. While the two make seismic love on any available surface and Angela plots Dee's downfall in the ratings, a secret admirer (whose identity is more obvious than the author must have intended) writes her love notes. Then, one by one, he begins to kill off all the people who have hurt or betrayed her--and attempts to realize his insane dream of making Deanna entirely his own. A sexy hero whose no-nonsense presence cuts through the vapors and cattiness of the womenfolk and a convincing behind-the-scenes look at TV--both help make up for the weak humor, implausible plot, and trite glitz of this predictable novel. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His reputation for controversy is exceeded only by a universal respect for his intellect and passion. As Gary Giddons notes: Stanley may be the only jazz writer out there with the kind of rhinoceros hide necessary to provoke and outrage and then withstand the fulminations that come back.&#x201d; In <i>Considering Genius</i>, Crouch collects some of his best loved, most influential, and most controversial pieces (published in <i>Jazz Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, and elsewhere), together with two new essays. The pieces range from the introspective Jazz Criticism and Its Effect on the Art Form&#x201d; to a rollicking debate with Amiri Baraka, to vivid, intimate portraits of the legendary performers Crouch has known.</p><p><b>Stanley Crouch</b> is a columnist, novelist, essayist, and television commentator. He has served since 1987 as an artistic consultant at Lincoln Center and is a co-founder of the department known as Jazz at Lincoln Center. He is the author of <i>Notes of a Hanging Judge</i> and <i>The Artificial White Man</i>, among other titles. He lives in New York City.Although Crouch, the determinedly iconoclastic and always controversial critic, has cast his net widely over the last few years--declaiming on various social issues that swirl around but are never limited to race--he began as a jazz writer, albeit one who was never shy about combining musical analysis with cultural criticism. This collection brings together a healthy sampling of his jazz writings dating from 1977 to the present. A long and spirited prologue, "Jazz Me Blues," lays out Crouch's jazz aesthetic, but he really shows his stuff in the essays on particular musicians, combining trenchant analysis of the artist with fascinating biographical material and feeling free to speculate at will about the psychology and inner lives of such jazz greats as Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and John Coltrane. Nearly every essay has a pocketful of rare nuggets like this snippet on Ben Webster: "Webster was a big man known to turn out bars and appear drunk at European airports with wilting bouquets, weeping, as Betty Carter recalled, because he had just missed doing it right once again." Essential reading for jazz fans. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Over the next ten years, as she continued her schoolteaching career and carved out a home for herself in this inhospitable territory, she sent a steady stream of letters to her family back in Iowa. From the edge of modern America, Bess wrote long, gossipy accounts&#x2014;"our own continuing adventure story," according to her brother Paul&#x2014;of frontier life on the high plains west of the Missouri River. Irrepressible, independent-minded, and evidently fearless, the self-styled Bachelor Bess gives us a firsthand, almost daily account of her homesteading adventures.

A lively and informative correspondent, Corey uses a multitude of details to flesh out the quotidian activities on her 160-acre claim: designing a brand to mark her stock, sitting for exams to maintain her teaching credentials, juggling meager funds for building materials to improve her property, shooting a rabbit in her garden ("I had to give him a little persuasive gun talk to get him to stay for dinner") and dressing in "three layers of wool all over" as protection from the bitterly cold winters. Often her descriptions bubble with good humor: she suggests a law requiring that all marriage proposals be oral; when they're written, there's no way to stop the man from asking. However, elsewhere Corey ends with the plaintive postscript, "I'm so homesick." Gerber's work includes Critical Essays on Robert Frost.

In addition to the machine itself, the accessories include the cutters, cutter chucks, workpiece clamps, vices, angle plates, dividing heads, rotary tables, boring heads and other minor items. The content is divided into three main sections. Firstly, it describes what machines and accessories are available and covering each one in detail. The author explains which are essential and which can be obtained when the workshop activity eventually demands one. There are also suggestions on how the equipment chosen should be installed. The usage of each machine and accessory is covered for all but their most complex uses. Typically, using the rotary table and the dividing head are both described to a detail sufficient for the majority of uses that will surface in the home workshop. The third section deals with the actual machining process, covering the choice of the cutter for the task in hand, the speeds to use and how the direction of the feed relative to the cutter rotation is vitally important. A less-understood feature of milling, back cutting, is also explained.</p><p>Harold Hall was for a number of years the editor of Model Engineers&#39; Workshop magazine and through its pages, he established himself as a mentor to tyro model engineers worldwide.

That was the nickname of Ali Hassan Salameh, a Palestinian who oversaw the Black September Organization from 1970 until his murder by car bomb in 1979. Salameh masterminded the 1972 hijacking of Sabena flight 572 to Tel Aviv, killing 27 tourists at Israel's Lod airport, and the murder of the Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in Munich. In 1973, he organized the murder of the American and Saudi ambassadors in Sudan. The Red Prince's story is also that of General Aharon "Arale" Yariv, Golda Meir's choice to run Israel's counterterrorism response, and of Zvi Zamir, the head of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence unit. As The Quest for The Red Prince unfolds, Zamir and Yariv orchestrate a series of daring cross-border assassinations, picking off Black September members one by one, chasing down Salameh until a final reckoning in Beirut. The Quest for The Red Prince does more than catalog the awful crimes of a terrorist, and Israel's search for a way to end his bloody reign: it authoritatively recounts the history of one of the central conflicts of our time - the Palestinian-Israeli struggle.

Drawing on a wide range of literary, visual, and critical works in the European tradition, Gordon Teskey provides both a literary history of allegory and a theoretical account of the genre which confronts fundamental questions about the violence inherent in cultural forms.Approaching allegory as the site of intense ideological struggle, Teskey argues that the desire to raise temporal experience to ever higher levels of abstraction cannot be realized fully but rather creates a &#34;rift&#34; that allegory attempts to conceal. After examining the emergence of allegorical violence from the gendered metaphors of classical idealism, Teskey describes its amplification when an essentially theological form of expression was politicized in the Renaissance by the introduction of the classical gods, a process leading to the replacement of allegory by political satire and cartoons. He explores the relationship between rhetorical voice and forms of indirect speech (such as irony) and investigates the corporeal emblematics of violence in authors as different as Machiavelli and Yeats. He considers the large organizing theories of culture, particularly those of Eliot and Frye, which take the place in the modern world of earlier allegorical visions. Concluding with a discussion of the Mutabilitie Cantos, Teskey describes Spenser&#39;s metaphysical allegory, which is deconstructed by its own invocation of genealogical struggle, as a prophetic vision and a form of warning.</p><p><p>Gordon Teskey is Professor of English at Cornell University. He is co-editor, with George M. Logan, of Unfolded Tales: Essays on Renaissance Romance, also from Cornell.</p><p>"Teskey mingles much learnedness with some of the most powerful analysis to which allegory has ever been subjected. It is a rich brew, but entirely rewarding.... Teskey has written a remarkable work."</p> (Angus Fletcher, Modern Language Quarterly)<br><br><p>"Gordon Teskey's truly remarkable book... inhabits as much as it unfolds the work of allegory. One crucial thing this book confronts is that the theory of allegory tends to be so relentlessly allegorical, projecting images of its own work that are by turns purificatory and obscene, images which may conceal or idealize the violence by which allegory works, and yet reveal its scope all the more powerfully by virtue of such displacement.... A book so alive to, and solicitous of, its own intellectual obsessions is rare. The author does not yield to any intellectual demands that he has not made his own?an unusual virtue in the current climate of criticism."</p> (Kenneth Gross, Spenser Newsletter)<br><br><p>"Reading this book, like reading an allegory, is as much a psychological as an intellectual experience. It disarms the critic prepared to challenge the details of its monumental argument, but not by dismissing contradiction and confrontation. Rather, it celebrates them as the inescapable essense of human life."</p> (Judith Rice Henderson, Canadian Review of Comparative Literature)</p><h2>Naval Flank of the Western Front</h2><p>Belgium was once described as the &#39;dagger held at the throat of England&#39;, a collection of provinces that had long been a critical factor in British foreign policy, and the traditional concern was that Belgium, and especially the Flanders coast, would fall into the hands of the strongest continental power. In 1914, Germany&#39;s occupation of Belgium brought about the spectre of enemy ships only seventy miles from the British coast, and the coast of Flanders became, effectively, the maritime flank of the Western Front. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was one of the few within the German navy who recognised the strategic potential of the three ports of Ostend, Zeebrugge and Brugges; that they were closer to England than the Helgoland Bight for access by small craft, and brought Germany to within a few hours sailing of the Thames estuary. This new book tells the story of the creation, purpose, operations and career of the MarineKorps Flandern.

Carl's many fans will welcome this charming glimpse inside his world, based on some real and not so real experiences in the author's life. This almost wordless fantasy includes winning entries from the Carl's Scrapbook contest.<br><br></p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1-The scene is set by the full-page painting opposite the title page on which a young girl and her mother are shown working on a scrapbook with Carl, their Rottweiler, watching attentively. The action begins when Mum sets the toddler and Carl up with a video while she goes out to garden. No sooner is she outside than Carl's paw stops the video and he and the child get out the scrapbook and boxes of pictures and set to work filling the pages. When the dog senses the mother's return, he paws the fast-forward button, the child climbs into the chair, Carl lies down on the scrapbook paraphernalia, and the two of them appear as innocent as lambs. Intervening double-page spreads are randomly filled with a melange of photographs, memorabilia, and curiosities important to Carl and his young mistress. While attractively presented and interesting to peruse, there is no obvious story line to intrigue children. In spite of the lovely paintings of winsome child and handsome dog, this book will be of limited appeal.<br><i>Virginia Opocensky, formerly at Lincoln City Libraries, NE</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 3-9. Left alone to watch a video while Mom gardens, toddler Madeleine and dog Carl turn off the VCR and take out Mom's scrapbook instead. On the left half of each double-page spread are Mom's tidily captioned photos of family, vacations, holidays, etc. Carl and Madeleine haphazardly fill the right-hand page with entries from Carl's Scrapbook Contest--photos of and articles about dogs and an array of other memorabilia--and drawings of Carl and Madeleine at work reveal the gummy steps in their endeavor. As Mom returns, the sticky chums quickly fast-forward the video and plop in front of the TV; it's obvious their mischief won't go undetected for long, however, for when Carl stands up, he is plastered with bits from their pasting. Youngsters meeting Carl for the first time will delight in these largely wordless antics, and fans of his earlier adventures will pore over the photos of his family and of him as a pup. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>Local Bounty: Vegan Seasonal Recipes</h2><p><i>Local Bounty<i> shows how a vegan diet, already healthful and environmentally sustainable, yields even greater advantages when seasonal foods are used in the recipes.

Dark and windblown, it lent him a look that held more than a hint of the rogue.<br><br>Then again, it had to be his eyes. They radiated from the photograph, silver-blue and electric, which was startling since the photograph was black and white. But Jenna McCue had seen those eyes in person, and once seen, they were never forgotten.<br><br>Feeling oddly as though they'd touched her even then, she flipped the book over to bury the back-cover photograph in the seat of the car, which left the front cover staring up at her. <em>Green Gold</em> was the title of the book. The story inside dealt with the search for emeralds in the mines of South Africa, and it was a true story. Spencer Smith had lived through the adventure and written about it just as he had written about his search for treasure in the shadow of the pyramids in Egypt, in the Peruvian Andes, in pirate coves of the South Seas. His books weren't bestsellers. They lacked the requisite elements for commercial success, namely melodrama and sex. Rather, they were well-written documentaries, sure to fascinate the adventurer-at-heart.<br><br>Jenna wasn't quite that, since her life was ruled by routine, but Spencer Smith was the brother of her oldest and dearest friend. She would have bought his books out of loyalty to Caroline and her family, even if she hadn't found them intriguing. But she loved each one. Over the years, she had become the unofficial, if biased, reviewer of his books on her visits with the Smiths.<br><br>This visit had a different purpose, though. True, she had read and loved <em>Green Gold,</em> and true, she wouldn't have missed the senior Smiths' fiftieth wedding anniversary party for the world, but she had more on her agenda than drinking champagne, eating lobster and waltzing across the dance floor with whoever chose to ask her to dance.<br><br>She had something to ask of Spencer Smith. A favor of sorts. A proposition of sorts. A personal, <em>very</em> personal request. An unusual one, for sure.<br><br>He might be incredulous or mocking, intrigued or repulsed. Caroline had suggested all those things by way of preparing Jenna for the worst, but she had agreed with Jenna's idea, and rightfully so. It was a good one. From the moment she'd thought of it, Jenna had known that it made perfect sense. It would satisfy a number of people on a number of different scores. All she had to do was to convince Spencer of that.<br><br>Turning onto the private lane that led to the Smiths' Newport home, she pulled up behind the last car in line, climbed out and set off toward the house. Her heels were pale yellow and high, not ideal for walking over a dirt road, but they went with her dress, which was silk with a short skirt and matching jacket, and the entire look went with her hair, which was loosely curled and feminine. Normally she dressed more sleekly and knotted her hair back, as befitted a top-level executive. But even aside from the occasion of the Smiths' party, she was feeling softer.<br><br>It had to do with where she was in life and what she wanted in her future, which was where Spencer came in.<br><br>Ignoring the gentle curling in the pit of her stomach, she walked on.<br><br>The closer she came to the house, the more people she saw. She recognized several and offered warm hellos, then was quickly introduced to others, and while those others might not have known her on sight, by reputation they did. McCue's was a venerable name in New England retailing. The McCue chain of department stores, falling somewhere in style between Bergdorf Goodman and Jordan Marsh, had survived good times and bad to become the stalwart outlet to which New Englanders went for everything from polo shirts and jeans to suede suits, sterling-silver picture frames and designer bed coverings. Jenna, as the last living McCue, was president and chairman of the board. At thirty-five, she was an effective and insightful leader. As her father and her grandfather before him had done, she kept the store apace with the times, which was why McCue's thrived while others felt the economy's pinch. She anticipated problems and dealt with them before they became debilitating in any way, shape or form.<br><br>She did the same with her personal life, which was why she had to talk with Spencer.<br><br>He wasn't in the foyer when she entered the house, or in the living room when she passed through on her way to the patio, where Joe and Abby Smith were accepting congratulations from their guests. Jenna gave them both affectionate hugs and chatted for several minutes before moving on to allow other guests access. She had barely taken a glass of wine from a passing tray, when Caroline materialized beside her.<br><br>"You look spectacular," she said, giving Jenna a prolonged once-over before adding a dubious, "did I see that dress at the store?"<br><br>Jenna glanced around casually to make sure no one was within earshot. There were perks to her profession, but she wasn't one to broadcast them. Sotto voce she admitted, "We ordered a few at the Paris show, then decided they'd be too pricey to carry in quantity. I took one of the few. Like it?"<br><br>"You know I do, but whether I'm more envious of the dress or your figure, I'm not sure. You're so slim. Lord, what I'd give to be a size six."<br><br>Jenna sent her a meaningful look. "Lord, what I'd give to have three kids." Her eyes searched the crowd. "Where are they?"<br><br>"Somewhere out there. I told Annie to watch Wes and Wes to watch Nathan, so the three should be running after one another all afternoon. I'm assuming someone else will notice if one of them falls into the pool."<br><br>"They're super kids," Jenna said, and meant it, though her eyes weren't at kid level as they continued to roam the crowd.<br><br>"He's not here yet," Caroline told her. "He called a while ago to say he'd run into thunderstorms over D.C. and had to detour to Pittsburgh for fuel. He says he's flying into Newport State. I wouldn't put it past him to land on our beach."<br><br>"He wouldn't."<br><br>The look Caroline sent her said that he very well would, and, giving it a second thought, Jenna didn't argue. For anyone other than Spencer Smith, landing on the rocky beach rimming Rhode Island Sound would be suicidal. But Spencer had a way of courting danger and emerging alive. Jenna supposed he could successfully land his Cessna on that narrow strip of sand, taxi up to the dock and step out of the cabin totally unruffled.<br><br>He was a strong man. He was an able man. He was a man with a natural curiosity, who wasn't afraid to ask questions or tackle the unknown. There were some who, in moments of sheer envy, called him a fool for taking the chances he did. But Jenna had read his books and knew that the opposite was true. As hare-brained as some of his escapades might appear on the surface, he never did anything without weighing the odds and ensuring that they were tipped in his favor. In that sense, he was extraordinarily intelligent.<br><br>Intelligent. Competent. Strong. Curious. Courageous. All were fine qualities, ones that Jenna admired, ones that a child of hers would have, if she had any say in the matter.<br><br>"He'll get here," Caroline said with a reassuring squeeze.<br><br>"But will he stay long enough for us to talk? I need privacy for this. It isn't the kind of question one pops with a zillion people listening in."<br><br>"He says he's staying through the weekend."<br><br>"He's said that before and then taken off. He has trouble sitting still."<br><br>"Only with his family. Set him up on the shores of Loch Ness, and he'll sit motionless for days waiting for the monster to surface. Newport makes him nervous. <em>We</em> make him nervous. He's convinced that the one thing we want most in life is to break him to a saddle." Caroline laughed. "As if we could." A second laugh turned into a groan. "What was that?"<br><br>Jenna had seen it, too, the streaking of a three-year-old child through the gathering of guests. "Looked like Nathan."<br><br>"Looked like wedding cake," Caroline muttered. "I'll kill him." With a murderous look, she was off.<br><br>Jenna watched her go, feeling both affection and envy. Then she took a deep breath and released it. Spencer wasn't there. He wouldn't arrive for a while. She could relax.<br><br>For the next two hours, she did just that. She liked the Smiths' friends, many of whom were her own, and socializing was second nature to her. Like Caroline, she had been raised in the lap of luxury. Her parents had had money to spare, and though they had loved traveling and eating out and donating hospital wings in their name, more than anything they had loved parties. From the earliest Jenna could remember, they were either throwing one or attending one. Out of sheer survival, Jenna had learned to mix, and though she had never developed the love for loud festivities that her parents had, she had come to be perfectly at ease. The key, she knew, was to smile, to indulge in amiable small talk, to read other people's needs and listen or respond accordingly&#x2014;without taking any of it seriously. Gossip never touched her. One part of her remained removed from it all and therefore protected.<br><br>She munched on the food that was first passed on silver trays, then offered in a lavish sit-down buffet. She chatted and laughed. She raised her glass when Caroline's husband, a state representative with a golden tongue, proposed a toast to his in-laws, and she couldn't help but think that Spencer should have been the one to do that. But he wouldn't have. Not even if he'd come on time. As adventurous as the man was, he wasn't a showman. As compelling as he was, he shunned the limelight. While another man in his shoes would have brought a film crew along on his trips, Spencer refused. He was determined to enjoy adventure for adventure's sake. If a book came later, fine. If the book was spiced up and made into a movie, that was fine, too. He would serve as a technical consultant, but that was all.<br><br>Spencer's toast wasn't missed. There were plenty of others, offered by various and sundry of the Smiths' friends and relatives, to the extent that the guests ceased to sit between toasts. Even then, when Spencer appeared on the outskirts of the crowd, Jenna saw him at once. He was that kind of man. Standing six foot four, he was taller than most others in the room, but that wasn't what did it, as much as his aura. Complemented by his roguishly dark good looks and the confidence of his stance, he exuded independence, self-containment and, while not quite disdain, a disinclination to play games by any rules other than his own.<br><br>Jenna hadn't seen Spencer for six years, yet she felt his force at once. It was far stronger than anything she'd encountered on the back of a book jacket and it gave her a moment's pause. She wasn't sure she could approach him. He was so...<em>much.</em> And she'd never been terribly good with men in anything but business.<br><br>But this <em>was</em> business, she reminded herself, and with that thought stilled her wildly beating heart. She couldn't take her eyes from him, though, but watched him take in the situation and back off. He would wait, she knew, until the toasts were done. In the flurry of movement when people returned to their seats, he would slip into his own at his parents' table.<br><br>That was what he did. Slowly word spread that he was there, and though no one dared raise a glass to the success of <em>Green Gold,</em> those closest to the family made a point of going over to greet the author. The rest kept their distance, and wisely so. Spencer had never been the kiss-kiss type. His silver-blue eyes were legendary in their ability to cut phonies down with a glance.<br><br>Jenna, too, kept her distance, though not from fear of being cut down. As Caroline's friend, she had immunity. Spencer had always been kind to her, even gentle, just as he was to his sister. For whatever differences he had with his parents, Caroline was special to him. He never failed to call her on her birthday or to send a gift to one of her children on theirs. Jenna respected him for that. She also took it as a clue to his character, a part of him few people saw. She was counting on the clue being apt.<br><br>No, it wasn't fear of Spencer that kept Jenna from rushing up to him, as much as a desire to carefully control her approach. Her mission was a delicate one. She wanted to maximize her chance of success. Or so she told herself. But long after the band started playing and people had moved onto the dance floor, she hung back. She immersed herself in conversation with people who stood at the greatest distance from Spencer. She walked Annie, Wes and Nathan down to the beach when she was sure Spencer was with followers in the gazebo. She finally agreed to Charleston with an old family friend, but quickly moved off into the crowd and oblivion the instant the dance was done. When coffee was served and a tiered wedding cake rolled onto the lawn, minus several frosting roses that small fingers had filched, she clung to the fringes.<br><br>Her time would come, she knew. When the guests had left and things had quieted, Spencer would be feeling mellow. A mellow Spencer would be more approachable than one whose defenses were in place. A mellow Spencer would be more disposed to consider her proposal. A mellow Spencer would be more likely to accept.<br><br></p><h2>The Red Hot Chili Peppers (Bass)</h2><p>(Signature Licks Bass).

Original.</p><p>David Rees is the author of the cult-hit comic books <i>Get Your War On</i>, <i>My New Fighting Technique Is Unstoppable</i>, and <i>My New Filing Technique Is Unstoppable</i>. His "Get Your War On" comic appears in every issue of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and he runs a website, www.mnftiu.cc. In his spare time he writes songs for his band, Skeleton Killers.Rees began assembling his comic commentary on U.S. politics after 9/11, and since then he's remained faithful to his simple, remarkably powerful style. In each strip, anonymous office workers (portrayed as one-dimensional clip art figures) discuss the day's political events, either over the phone or while sitting around the conference table. Oddly, this combination of expressionless characters and strident commentary makes for some of the most consistent, wickedly funny political cartooning out there today. This collection presents the series of three- and four-panel comics Rees has posted on his Web site (www.mnftiu.cc) at regular intervals since late 2002. The characters ponder the effect of the war in Iraq on Afghanistan's citizens, wondering, "Remember those leftover civilians in that country where we waged our last war a few months ago? Do they realize they're one war away from being completely forgotten?" They contemplate the Patriot Act: "You think once they have Benjamin Franklin's body spinning in his grave fast enough, they'll be able to power an internal combustion engine with it?" And they question the possible reinstatement of Henry Kissinger to the September 11 Commission: "Jesus Christ, are we fucking MOVING BACKWARDS IN TIME???" Rees's work is a comic juggernaut; with a laugh and a groan in every strip, he never misses. Although this relentless skewering could grow stale, Rees's keen understanding of politics and history, and his passion for American freedoms, keeps the work surging forward. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her boldly original landscapes are praised today for capturing an untamed British Columbia and its indigenous peoples just before industrialization would change them forever. Now Susan Vreeland brings to life this fiercely independent and underappreciated figure.</p></p><p>Novelist Susan Vreeland has made a career of fictionalizing the lives of artists and of particular paintings, like Artemisia Gentileschiï¿½s magnificent <i>Judith</i> in <i>The Passion of Artemisia</i>. In her third novel, <i>The Forest Lover,</i> Vreeland's subject is the courageous Canadian painter Emily Carr, who traveled through native villages and wilderness of British Columbia in the early 1900s, often alone, on a quest to paint totem poles and other artifacts before the indigenous traditions died out and the poles were destroyed or sold. Vreeland's Carr is deeply respectful of the people she meets, and is rewarded with their trust and their stories. She brings the same sensitivity with her to Paris to see the new art, is exhibited at the Salon d'Automne, and returns to Vancouver in 1912 with a style so direct, and colors so expressive, that a conservative local reviewer dubs her a wild beast, literally, a Fauve. Vreeland's strength is in the tacks of emotion during dialogue, and in her nimble, exact prose. As she depicts her, Carr is an endearing and believable balance of sensitivity and determination&#x2039;an artist of life as well as a remarkable painter. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Coming out of the Louvre for the first time in 1971, dizzy with new love, I stood on Pont Neuf and made a pledge to myself that the art of this newly discovered world in the Old World would be my life companion. Never had history been more vibrant, its voices more resonating, its images more gripping. On this first trip to Europe, I felt myself a pilgrim: To me, even secular places such as museums and ruins were imbued with the sacred. Painting, sculpture, architecture, music, religious and social history--I was swept away with all of it, wanting to read more, to learn languages, to fill my mind with rich, glorious, long-established culture wrought by human desire, daring, and faith. I wanted to keep a Gothic cathedral alive in my heart. My imagination exploded with the gaiety of the Montmartre dancers at Moulin de la Galette, the laborer whose last breath in his flattened chest was taken under the weight of a stone fallen from the Duomo under construction in Florence, the apprentice who cut himself preparing glass for the jeweled windows of Sainte Chapelle, the sweating quarry worker aching behind his crowbar at Carrara to release a marble that would become the <i>Pietï¿½.</i> In a fashion I couldn't imagine then, I have been true to this pledge. I have brought to life the daughter of the Dutch painter Vermeer who secretly yearned to paint the Delft she loved. I've given voice to the Italian Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, raped at seventeen by her painting teacher, the first woman to paint large scale figures from history and scripture previously reserved for men. On my own continent, I've entered deep British Columbian forests with Emily Carr, whose love for native people took her to places proper white women didn't go. My imagination has followed Modigliani's daughter around Paris searching for shreds of information about the father she never knew. I've imagined myself a poor wetnurse, bereaved of her own baby so that a rich woman, Berthe Morisot, might paint. I've taken my seventeenth century Tuscan shoemaker to Rome to have his longed-for religious experience under the Sistine ceiling. I've followed Renoir's models to cabarets and boat races, to war and elopement, to the Folies-Bergï¿½re and luncheons by the Seine. <p>Now some facts as to how I arrived there: After graduating from San Diego State University, I taught high school English in San Diego beginning in 1969 and retired in 2000 after a 30-year career. Concurrently, I began writing features for newspapers and magazines in 1980, taking up subjects in art and travel, and publishing 250 articles. I ventured into fiction in 1988 with <i>What Love Sees</i>, a biographical novel of a woman's unwavering determination to lead a full life despite blindness. The book was made into a CBS television movie starring Richard Thomas and Annabeth Gish. My short fiction has appeared in <i>The Missouri Review, Ploughshares, New England Review, Confrontation, Alaska Quarterly Review, Manoa, Connecticut Review, Calyx, Crescent Review, So To Speak </i>and elsewhere. </p><b>My art-related fiction, products of my pledge on Pont Neuf:</b><i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>, 1999, and a Hallmark Hall of Fame production in 2003, tracing an alleged Vermeer painting through the centuries revealing its influence on those who possessed it. <br><i>The Passion of Artemisia</i>, 2002, disclosing the inner life of Artemisia Gentileschi, Italian Baroque painter who empowered her female heroines with her own courage. <i>The Forest Lover</i>, 2004, following the rebel Canadian painter, Emily Carr, seeking the spiritual content of her beloved British Columbia by painting its wild landscape and its native totemic carvings. <br><i>Life Studies</i>, 2005, stories revealing Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters from points of view of people who knew them, and showing that ordinary people can have profound encounters with art. <br><i>Luncheon of the Boating Party</i>, 2007, illuminating the vibrant, explosive Parisian world of <i>la vie moderne</i> surrounding Renoir as he creates his masterwork depicting the French art of living.<p> <b>Selected awards:</b></p><p><i>New York Times Best Sellers: Girl in Hyacinth Blue, The Passion of Artemisia, Luncheon of the Boating Party. </i><br>Book Sense Pick, <i>Luncheon of the Boating Party</i>, 2007. <br>Book Sense Year's Favorites, for <i>The Passion of Artemisia</i>, 2002. <br>Book Sense Book of the Year Finalist, <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>, 1999. <br>International Dublin Literary Award, Nominee, for <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>, 2001. <br><i>Independent Publisher Magazine</i>, Storyteller of the Year, for <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>, 1999. <br><i>Foreword Magazine's</i> Best Novel of the Year, for Girl in Hyacinth Blue,1999. <br>San Diego Book Awards' Theodor Geisel Award and Best Novel of the Year, 1999, for <i>Girl</i>; 2002 for <i>Artemisia</i>, and 2005 for <i>Life Studies</i>. </p><p>My work has been translated into twenty-five languages.</p><p>So, what have I learned from all of this? That entering the mind and heart of painters has taught me to see, and to be more appreciative of the beauties of the visible world. That I can agree with Renoir when he said, "I believe that I am nearer to God by being humble before his splendor (Nature)." That people are hungry for real lives behind the paintings. That readers' lives have been enriched, their sensibilities sharpened, even their goals for their own creative endeavors given higher priorities in their lives.</p><p>And especially this: Thanks to art, instead of seeing only one world and time period, our own, we see it multiplied and can peer into other times, other worlds which offer windows to other lives. <b>Each time we enter imaginatively into the life of another, it's a small step upwards in the elevation of the human race.</b> Consider this: Where there is no imagination of others' lives, there is no human connection. Where there is no human connection, there is no chance for compassion to govern. Without compassion, then loving kindness, human understanding, peace all shrivel. Individuals become isolated, and the isolated can turn resentful, narrow, cruel; they can become blinded, and that's where prejudice, holocausts, terrorism and tragedy hover. Art--and literature--are antidotes to that. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Revolt Against the Masses: How Liberalism Has Undermined the Middle Class</h2><p>This short book rewrites the history of modern American liberalism. It shows that what we think of liberalism today the top and bottom coalition we associate with President Obama - began not with Progressivism or the New Deal but rather in the wake of the post-WWI disillusionment with American society. In the twenties, the first writers and thinkers to call themselves liberals adopted the hostility to bourgeois life that had long characterized European intellectuals of both the left and the right. The aim of liberalism&#x2019;s foundational writers and thinkers such as Herbert Croly, Randolph Bourne, H.G. Wells, Sinclair Lewis and H.L Mencken was to create an American aristocracy of sorts, to provide a sense of hierarchy and order associated with European statism.<br><br>Like communism, Fabianism, and fascism, modern liberalism, critical of both capitalism and democracy, was born of a new class of politically self-conscious intellectuals. They despised both the individual businessman's pursuit of profit and the conventional individual's pursuit of pleasure, both of which were made possible by the lineaments of the limited nineteenth-century state.<br><br>Temporarily waylaid by the heroism of the WWII generation, in the 1950s liberalism expressed itself as a critique of popular culture. It was precisely the success of elevating middle class culture that frightened foppish characters like Dwight Macdonald and Aldous Huxley, crucial influences on what was mistakenly called the New Left. There was no New Left in the 1960s, but there was a New Class which in the midst of Vietnam and race riots took up the priestly task of de-democratizing America in the name of administering newly developed rights<br><br>The neo-Mathusianism which emerged from the 60s was, unlike its eugenicist precursors, aimed not at the breeding habits of the lower classes but rather the buying habits of the middle class.<br><br>Today&#x2019;s Barack Obama liberalism has displaced the old Main Street private sector middle class with a new middle class composed of public sector workers allied with crony capitalists and the country&#x2019;s arbiters of style and taste.</p><p>Fred Siegel is the author, most recently, of <i>The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York, and the Genius of American Life</i> (2005), which received the cover review in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. His previous book, <i>The Future Once Happened Here: New York, D.C., L.A., and the Fate of America&#x2019;s Big Cities</i>, was named by Peter Jennings as one of the 100 most important books about the U.S. in the twentieth century. He has written widely on American and European politics and was described as the historian of the American city&#x201d; in a November 2011 profile in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.<br><br>The former editor of <i>City Journal</i>, he has written for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>New York Times, The Atlantic, Commentary, The New Republic, Dissent</i>, and many other publications. He has also appeared widely on TV and radio.<br><br>A former senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., Mr. Siegel is currently a scholar in residence at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. <br><br> The roots of American liberalism are not compassion but snobbery. So argues historian Fred Siegel in <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i>. Siegel traces the development of liberalism from the cultural critics of the post WWI years to the gentry liberals today, and he shows how the common thread is scorn for middle-class Americans and for America itself. This is a stunningly original and convincing book.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Michael Barone</b>, senior political analyst at the <i>Washington Examiner</i>, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and co-author of <i>The Almanac of American Politics</i><br><br> Fred Siegel&#x2019;s superb <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i> should be required reading for those who wonder how liberal elites came to dominate our culture, overriding the will of the people. Siegel&#x2019;s book is history at its best and most relevant.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Roger L. Simon</b>, Academy Award nominated screenwriter, author, and founder of PJ Media<br><br> In <i>The Revolt Against the Masses</i>, Fred Siegel reveals the intellectual underpinnings of today&#x2019;s ascendant gentry liberalism, which leaves old-fashioned liberals, including, I suspect, Siegel himself, politically homeless. The increasingly anti-democratic character of liberalism also undermines much of the reason we became progressives in the first place, which was to help the middle and working classes. The gentry&#x2019;s stridency and hypocrisy what&#x2019;s OK for them is not for everyone else is utterly transforming liberalism today. The progressives portrayed in this book are not so much the heirs of Jefferson or Jackson or even Roosevelt, as they are the American heirs of the worst high-toned Tories.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Joel Kotkin</b>, author of <i>The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050</i><br></p><h2>Under the Rainbow: Growing Up Gay (Stonewall Inn Classics)</h2><p>Recounts the author&#39;s experiences of growing up gay during the 1950s and his involvement in the early gay rights movement</p><p>Originally published in 1977, Kantrowitz's account of coming to terms with his sexuality in the early years of the Gay Rights movement is brought back into print as part of the Stonewall Inn Classics series. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."Kantrowitz wins us with his honesty and vulnerability," said LJ's reviewer of this story of a gay activist pioneer (LJ 6/15/77).

One of the most recurring falsehoods that is used by the enemies of the Greek Traditional Text or Received Text is the almost unbelievable falsehood that the Greek text was not in existence until 1516 A.D. with Erasmus. This volume thunders out an effective reply to the serious errors of this false position. It proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the Traditional Text was in the hands of the churches in a continuous time line from the original Apostolic times down to the present.</p><p>[This selection is taken from Chapter 12--Conclusion.] The Traditional Text has now been traced, from the earliest years of Christianity of which any record of the New Testament remains, to the period when it was enshrined in a large number of carefully-written manuscripts in a main accord with one another. Proof has been given from the writings of the early Fathers, that the idea that the Traditional Text arose in the middle of the fourth century is a mere hallucination, prompted by only a partial acquaintance with those writings. <p>And witness to the existence and predominance of that form of Text has been found in the Peshitto Version and in the best of the Latin Versions, which themselves also have been followed back to the beginning of the second century or the end of the first. We have also discovered the truth, that the settlement of the Text, thought mainly made in the fourth century, was not finally accomplished till the eighth century at the earliest; and that the later Uncials, not the oldest, together with the cursives express, not singly, not in small batches or companies, but in their main agreement, the decisions which had grown up in the Church. </p><p>In so doing, attention has been paid to all the existing evidence: none has been omitted. "Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus", has been the underlying principle. The foundations of the building have been laid as deeply and as broadly as our power could allow. No other course would be in consonance with scientific procedure. </p><p>The seven notes of truth have been made as comprehensive as possible. Antiquity, number, variety, weight, continuity, context, and internal evidence, include all points of view and all methods of examination, which are really sound. </p><p>The characters of the Vatican, Sinatic, and Bezan manuscripts have been shewn to be bad, and the streams which led to their production from Syrio-Old-Latin and Alexandrian sources to the temporary school of Caesarea have been traced and explained. It has been also shewn to be probable that corruption began and took root even before the Gospels were written. </p><p>The general conclusion which has grown upon our minds has been that the affections of Christians have not been misdirected; that the strongest exercise of reason has proved their instincts to have been sound and true; that the Text which we have used and loved rests upon a vast and varied support; that the multiform record of Manuscripts, Versions, and Fathers, is found to defend by large majorities in almost all instances those precious words of Holy Writ, which have been called in question during the latter half of this century. </p><p>We submit that it cannot be denied that we have presented a strong case, and naturally we look to see what has been said against it, since except in some features it has been before the World and the Church for some years. We submit that it has not received due attention from opposing critics. If indeed the opinions of the other School had been preceded by, or grounded upon, a searching examination, such as we have made in the case of B and Aleph, of the vast mass of evidence upon which we rest,--if this great body of testimony had been proved to be bad from overbalancing testimony or otherwise,--we should have found reason for doubt, or even for a reversal of our decisions. </p><p>But Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tishendorf laid down principles chiefly, if not exclusively, on the score of their intrinsic probability. Westcott and Hort built up their own theory upon reasoning internal to it, without clearing the ground first by any careful and detailed scrutiny. Besides which, all of them constructed their buildings before travellers by railways and steamships had placed within their reach the larger part of the materials which are now ready for use. [Several paragraphs have been omitted.] </p><p>We hear constantly the proclamation made in dogmatic tones that they are right: no proof adequate to the strength of our contention has been worked out to shew that we are wrong. </p><p>To conclude, the system which we advocate will be seen to contrast strikingly with that which is upheld by the opposing school, in three general ways: I. We have with us width and depth against the narrowness on their side. . . . II. We oppose facts to their speculation . . . . III. Our opponents are gradually getting out of date: the world is drifting away from them. Thousands of manuscripts have been added to the known stores since Tichendorf formed his system, and Hort begin to theorize, and their handful of favourite documents has become by comparison less and less. </p><p>Since the deaths of both of those eminent critics, the treasures dug up in Egypt and elsewhere have put back the date of the science of paleography from the fourth century after the Christian era to at least the third century before, and papyrus has sprung up into unexpected prominence in the ancient and medieval history of writing. It is discovered that there was no uncial period through which the genealogy of cursives has necessarily passed. Old theories on those points must generally be reconstructed if they are to tally with known facts. </p><p>But this accession of knowledge which puts our opponents in the wrong, has no effect on us except to confirm our position with new proof. Indeed, we welcome the unlocking of the all but boundless treasury of ancient wealth, since our theory, being as open as possible, and resting upon the visible and real, remains not only uninjured but strengthened. If it were to require any re-arrangement, that would be only a re-ordering of particulars, not of our principles which are capacious enough to admit of any additions of materials of judgement.

Having no money or servants, Georgie calls on her grandfather and his neighbor to act as butler and cook.

Georgie and Hanni are escorted away by Georgie's love interest, sexy Irishman Darcy O'Mara (Her Royal Spyness, 2007). As Georgie attempts to keep Hanni out of trouble, more murders follow.

As teenage memories and emotions resurface, the women relive the horror of a long-buried secret. Now a major film directed by Jordan Scott and starring Eva Green, &#34;Cracks&#34; is a mesmerising and shocking story of teenage sexuality, longing and identity.</p><p>Put adolescents together in a confined environment with only minimal adult supervision, and bad things will happen--a truism in literature as well as life. (Think <i>The Children's Hour</i>, think <i>Lord of the Flies</i>.) But in Sheila Kohler's eerie, atmospheric <i>Cracks</i>, the bad things that will happen are not the ones you might expect, and the message is far more complex than just "Children are savages." (Although they certainly are.) Written in an ominously anonymous first person plural, the novel follows the 12 girls on the swim team at a South African boarding school. They include the jock, the pretty one, the brain, the fat girl, and perhaps most interestingly, the shadowy Sheila Kohler, a storyteller whose tales all "came to the same dramatic finale: violent death..." All of them are in love with the dashing Miss G, their swim instructor, and a "crack," as it turns out, is a crush--the embodiment of all of adolescence's formless yearnings: <blockquote> When you had a crack you saw things more clearly: the thick dark of the shadows and the transparence of the oak leaves in the light and the soft glow of the pink magnolia petals against their waxy leaves. You wanted to lie down alone in the dark in the music room and listen to Rachmaninoff and to the summer rains rushing hard down the gutters. You left notes for your crack in her mug next to her toothbrush on the shelf in the bathroom. If you accidentally brushed up against your crack and felt her boosie, you nearly fainted. </blockquote> When they're not swimming, the members of the team amuse themselves by torturing new girls and taking turns fainting in chapel, until Fiamma Coronna throws everything off balance. A breathtaking Italian princess, a first-class swimmer, Fiamma quickly earns the girls' enmity by becoming Miss G's favorite. Worse still, she shows no interest in her teammates at all, and the usual hazing soon escalates to something far more serious. Heat dust, frangipani, adolescent sexuality simmering just under the surface: this could all have gone terribly, terribly wrong. It doesn't, and Kohler's elegant prose is the main reason why. The girls may be overheated, but the author's language never is. <i>--Chloe Byrne</i><b>Sheila Kohler</b> is the author of five novels, including <i>Cracks, Crossways, The Perfect Place</i>, and <i>Children of Pithiviers</i> (all available in paperback from Other Press). <i>Cracks</i> was chosen by <i>New York Newsday</i> and <i>Library Journal</i> as one of the best books of 1999.

In five autobiographical essays, Jean Amery describes his survival -- mental, moral, and physical -- through the enormity of the Holocaust. Above all, this masterful record of introspection tells of a young Viennese intellectual&#39;s fervent vision of human nature and the betrayal of that vision. Amery depicts the futile attempts of the intellect to cope with the overwhelming realities of Auschwitz. His torture is perceived as a reduction of self to the purely physical, with an accompanying loss of faith in the world. He struggles to come to terms with exile from his homeland as well as his feelings upon returning to the country of his persecutors. Finally, Amery, once the totally peripheral Jew, explains how complete acceptance of his Jewish identity, as compelled by his experiences in Auschwitz, is the only way in which he can regain human dignity.</p><p>Because Auschwitz was among the most brutal of the concentration camps, ruled by capricious, pure force and not by any discernable political or social structure, the intellectual there "was alone with his intellect ... and there was no social reality that could support and confirm it." In other words, there was no place for the intellect to act, outside of the confines of a person's own skull. Jean Amery's <i>At The Mind's Limits</i> is a focused meditation on the position of the intellectual placed in "a borderline situation, where he has to confirm the reality and effectiveness of his intellect, or to declare its impotence: in Auschwitz." In the camp, Amery writes, "The intellect very abruptly lost its basic quality: its transcendence." Considering this loss, Amery describes his own experience of torture, his reactions of resentment, anger, and bitterness, his loss of any vital sense of metaphysical questions, and his search for some way to maintain moral character and Jewish identity in the absence of such consciousness. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Jean Amery (1912-1978) was born in Vienna and in 1938 emigrated to Belgium, where he joined the Resistance Movement. He was caught by the Germans in 1943, tortured by the SS, and survived the next two years in the concentration camps. He was author of seven volumes of essays and two novels. He committed suicide in 1978.Sidney Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Professor of German at Oberlin College, and Stella P.

But when their start-up, PayPal, survived the dot.com crash only to find itself besieged by unimaginable challenges, that dream threatened to become a nightmare. PayPal&#39;s history - as told by former insider Eric Jackson - is an engrossing study of human struggle and perseverance against overwhelming odds. The entrepreneurs that Thiel and Levchin recruited to overhaul world currency markets first had to face some of the greatest trials ever thrown at a Silicon Valley company before they could make internet history. Business guru Tom Peters, author of In Search of Excellence, called the hardcover edition of The PayPal Wars a real page turner that featured what he called the best description of business strategy unfolding in a world changing at warp speed.

But after their startup, PayPal, survived the dot-com crash only to find itself besieged by an unimaginable series of challenges, that dream threatened to become a nightmare. <p>Chronicled here for the first time, PayPal's history&#x2014;as told by former insider Eric Jackson&#x2014;is an engrossing story of human struggle and perseverance against overwhelming odds. PayPal went from unknown startup to online powerhouse in just two years, but for the company's employees it was not an easy journey. The entrepreneurs that Thiel and Levchin recruited to overhaul world currency markets first had to face one of the greatest series of trials ever thrown at a Silicon Valley company before becoming part of Internet lore. </p><p>Jackson's lively, blow-by-blow account of PayPal's death-defying beginnings and ferocious battles offers a detailed perspective that only an insider could provide. Read The PayPal Wars and you'll learn how: </p><p>ï¿½ EBay unleashed a no-holds-barred effort to dislodge an unwelcome PayPal from its site. </p><p>ï¿½ Organized crime attempted to ransack PayPal&#x2014;but the company fought back. </p><p>ï¿½ Turmoil pushed PayPal to the brink of insolvency before it turned its business around. </p><p>Faced with these daunting challenges, PayPal survived thanks to a unique corporate culture that empowered its talented employees to push the envelope. But an entrepreneurial environment and gifted people weren't enough to ward off every threat. "Our clashes with the credit card associations, the banking lobby, state regulators, foreign Mafioso, and litigation-happy lawyers significantly increased after our IPO," writes Jackson, adding that the public offering that was meant to strengthen PayPal with an infusion of cash ironically attracted a rogue's gallery of foes instead. </p><p>"The modern business environment," Jackson concludes, "turned out to be more hostile than even our fiercest competitor." This somber warning&#x2014;that regulators, lawyers, and lobbyists threaten to undermine American entrepreneurship&#x2014;makes The PayPal Wars a timely read for every businessman, investor, and concerned citizen.</p></p><h2>Student Workbook Level A</h2><p>Students will learn to sound out unfamiliar words using decoding strategies such as sense clues, structural analysis, and spelling sound clues.</p><p></p><h2>Tooth for a Tooth (DCI Andy Gilchrist) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2012] T F Muir</h2><p>This Book is Brand new international softcover edition delivered within 7-12 working days via UPS/USPS/DHL and FEDEX.(FOR SALE ONLY U.S. &amp; U.K.)</p><p>Born in Glasgow and now a dual UK/US citizen, T.F.

His latest, The Meating Room, has been hailed as one of the best of a brilliant series. He is now working on his next Gilchrist novel, another story suffused with dark alleyways, cobbled streets and all things gruesome.<b>Chapter 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>October 2004</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Detective Chief Inspector Andy Gilchrist stood alone at the back of the chapel as the curtains closed on the coffin of his ex-wife. He barely heard the prayer of committal as he watched his son, Jack, place an arm around Maureen in the family group in the front pew. Beside them shuddered the grieving figure of their stepfather, Harry. Even now, at the moment of Gail&#x2019;s final parting, Gilchrist could not find it in his heart to forgive Harry.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the chapel emptied, Gilchrist held back, tagging on to the end of the mourners, each giving their condolences to the family line as they shuffled through the vestibule.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack gave him a sad smile of surprise. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see you.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Late as usual,&#x2019;&#x201d; Gilchrist offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack&#x2019;s grip was firm, a son-to-father handshake meant to assure Gilchrist that Jack would be strong for all of them. The tremor in his chin said otherwise.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist pulled him in closer and gave him a hug. &#x201c;Mum&#x2019;s no longer suffering,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack nodded, tight-lipped, as they parted. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maureen went straight for a hug. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t sure you&#x2019;d come.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even through her heavy coat he could feel her bones, her body light enough to lift with ease, it seemed. She was thin, too thin. He tried to say something but found he could not trust his voice. Instead, he hugged her tighter, breathed her in, and pressed his lips to her ear.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll miss Mum,&#x201d; he managed to say.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, Dad.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave Harry a firm handshake and a wordless nod, conscious of Maureen&#x2019;s eyes on him, searching for signs of forgiveness. Then he was down the stone steps, marching across the car park, avoiding eye contact with family friends he did not know. From his car, he watched Jack and Maureen leave the chapel hand in hand, Harry in front, defeated and alone. Something in that simple formation told Gilchrist that Harry could never fill their paternal void. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He caught Maureen&#x2019;s eye as she prepared to step into the funeral car.&nbsp; <br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are you coming back?</i> she mouthed to him. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded as she slipped from his view, then he powered up his mobile and saw he had two missed calls, both from Stan. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Stan?&#x201d; Gilchrist asked. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Thought you might be interested in a skeleton, boss. Just been dug up.&#x201d; <br> Gilchrist switched on the ignition, slipped into Drive. &#x201c;Keep going.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;In Dairsie Cemetery. Uncovered while the lair was being opened for another burial. No coffin and not six feet under, boss. So we&#x2019;re definitely thinking murder.&#x201d; <br> Gilchrist eased his Mercedes SLK Roadster forward. Ahead, the funeral car cruised through the crematorium grounds, grey exhaust swirling in the October chill. The wake was being held in Haggs Castle Clubhouse, the golf club where Harry was a member. Gilchrist knew he should attend, for Jack and Maureen, for Gail&#x2019;s memory, too. But the thought of faking a face for Harry it was too much for him. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way, Stan.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> * * *<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist walked through the gate in the old stone wall and into the cemetery grounds.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The forensic tent was erected by a gnarled willow tree in the far corner. Yellow tape looped around it from headstone to headstone. As Gilchrist approached, Stan broke the connection on his mobile with a slap of its cover.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This skeleton,&#x201d; Gilchrist said, as he pushed his feet into his coveralls. &#x201c;Is it in good nick?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Right thigh bone chopped through by one of the gravediggers. But other than that, it seems perfect.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Whose plot were they preparing?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A local by the name of Lorella McLeod. Fair old age of eighty-seven. Passed away at the weekend and was to be laid to rest in the family plot next to her husband, Hamish. He died in &#x2019;69. So the grave&#x2019;s not been touched for thirty-odd years.&#x201d; Stan shook his head. &#x201c;Already checked our misper files for &#x2019;68 to &#x2019;75 and came up empty-handed.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What about the PNC?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Got Nance doing that, even as we speak.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist pulled his coveralls up and over his shoulders, his mind working through Stan&#x2019;s rationale. &#x201c;Did the McLeods have children?&#x201d; he asked.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;None. Mrs. McLeod lived by herself.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;For the last what, thirty-five years?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m told, boss. But I haven&#x2019;t confirmed that yet.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist looked away. Tree-covered hills were already greying with the coming of winter. It seemed unimaginable for someone to live alone for that length of time, and he wondered if the end of his life would be as destitute. Sadness swept through him at that thought. <i>The end of his life.</i> Or more correctly, <i>part</i> of it. Gail was now gone, and he worried he would spend even less time with Jack and Maureen. He forced his mind to focus on the present and eyed the forensic tent.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So, Stan, it looks like we&#x2019;re dealing with a thirty-five-year-old murder.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Bit soon to jump to that conclusion, boss. The body could have been buried any time since the burial of Hamish McLeod.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist zipped up his coveralls. &#x201c;But why was it buried in <i>that</i> grave, Stan? Have you asked yourself that?&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stan scratched his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult to imagine a more perfect place to hide a body. I mean, who would look for it in a cemetery?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But why that particular grave?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Boss?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Because it would have been <i>fresh</i>, that&#x2019;s why. And if there is no coffin, there was no funeral. And if there was no funeral, no one knew about it. Therefore, we have a thirty-five-year-old murder on our hands.&#x201d; He stared off to the edge of the cemetery and the open fields beyond. Scotland in the sun was like no other place on earth. But its blue skies offered only false promise of a fine day. &#x201c;Not exactly thriving, is it, Stan?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Dead center of town, boss.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist almost smiled. &#x201c;Ever been here before, Stan? In this cemetery?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Neither have I. Which makes me think neither have a lot of people. So start off by making a list of all those who attended McLeod&#x2019;s funeral.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stan livened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get onto it, boss. Door to door, discreet like, see who knows what,&#x201d; he said as he walked away. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the outside, the <i>Incitent</i> gave the impression it would be cramped and dark, but the interior was suffused with a yellow light that seemed to lend a reverential quietness to the scene. Gilchrist counted four transparent plastic bags next to the open grave, each filled with bones the color of mud. A row of larger plastic bags full of earth lined one wall like a garden center. A camera sat on a silver metal case. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Four Scene of Crime Officers worked in silence while Gilchrist watched. One sifted through a heap of soil at the side of the grave. Another placed more muddied bones into a fifth bag, while two more scraped soil from the bottom of the opened grave with the focused intensity of biblical archaeologists. As Gilchrist stepped forward, one of the men in the grave looked up. Despite coveralls that hid his balding pate and made his face look round and tight, Gilchrist recognized Bert Mackie, not a SOCO, but the police pathologist from Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Any luck, Bert?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I expect you mean have we found any items of identification?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll do for starters.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Afraid not, Andy. All we have at the moment are bones. No watches, no jewelry.&nbsp;And the clothes have deteriorated to rags. Looks like she was wearing some sort of nylon jacket, but it&#x2019;s difficult to say at this stage&#x2014;&#x201c; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The bra gives the game away. Unless <i>he</i> was trying it on for size. Interestingly,&#x201d; he added, scowling at a muddied bone and scraping at it with his thumb, &#x201c;she appears not to have been wearing any knickers.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Could they have rotted away?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d expect to find traces of elastic.&#x201d; Mackie shook his head. &#x201c;None so far.&#x201d; <br> Gilchrist wondered if that was important. Why wear a bra, but no knickers? Had she just had sex, perhaps a <i>quickie</i>, and something was said that ended in violence? Had she been raped then murdered? Or did she simply like to walk around feeling free and airy, so to speak? &#x201c;Any ideas on her age?&#x201d; he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in a better position to confirm that after a full post-mortem, of course. But if I was pushed, I&#x2019;d say late teens, early twenties.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist squatted by the open grave. &#x201c;This no knickers thing,&#x201d; he persisted. &#x201c;Any thoughts?&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sex is always a grand motive,&#x201d; said Mackie. &#x201c;He wants some. She doesn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;s drunk. They argue. Turns into a fight, and before you know where you are, he has a fit and batters her to death.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mackie&#x2019;s explanation seemed brutally simplified, but Gilchrist had heard of less compelling motives. &#x201c;Too early to have a stab at cause of death?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Neil,&#x201d; snapped Mackie. &#x201c;Skull.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The SOCO by the plastic bags removed a dirty-brown skull from one of them and handed it to Mackie as if passing over the Crown Jewels.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mackie took it without a word, and Gilchrist noted that the teeth looked perfect. The skull&#x2019;s deformed shape confirmed the cause of death as blunt trauma. &#x201c;See here,&#x201d; said Mackie, pointing to a jagged hole in front of where the right ear would have been. The skull was indented and networked with cracks. &#x201c;Best guess would be a single blow to the temple. And to crush the skull like that, she was most likely dead when she hit the deck. Definitely unconscious. From the damage here,&#x201d; he said and ran his finger over the bone, &#x201c;to here, I&#x2019;d say not a hammer. The impact dent would have been more circular. And not an axe. The skull&#x2019;s been crushed, not cut.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Blunt axe?&#x201d; offered Gilchrist. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mackie shook his head. &#x201c;Something broader, more rounded. If she was killed at home, perhaps the base of a heavy table lamp. Now that would do it.&#x201d; Seemingly satisfied with his theory, Mackie offered the skull to Gilchrist.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist folded his arms. He had never been comfortable handling human remains. Not long after joining the Force, he had held the skull of a man shot through the head and found himself struggling to control his emotions as he visualized the bullet thudding into the forehead, ripping through the brain, and exiting in an eruption of blood and gore. Had the man felt any pain? Or just a numbing thud, followed by blind confusion then death? At what point in the bullet&#x2019;s passing had the man died? Gilchrist had managed to hand back the skull before vomiting on the mortuary floor. From that point on, he made sure to keep a safe distance.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a classic wound for someone murdered on the spur of the moment,&#x201d; said Mackie. &#x201c;Face to face. A heavy blow that crushed her skull and sent her flying, either dead or dying.&#x201d; He gave a slow-motion demonstration, holding an imaginary weapon and striking at the skull.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Left-handed, I see,&#x201d; said Gilchrist. &#x201c;Unless she was struck from behind, of course.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Mackie. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist stared at the battered skull. Had sex been the motive behind this young woman&#x2019;s murder? Had she put up a fight that ended in her death? Regardless of how she was killed, her disappearance would not have gone unreported. Someone would have missed her&#x2014;her parents, boyfriend, sister, brother. She could not have vanished without some stirring in the local press. Gilchrist had been with Fife Constabulary nigh on thirty years and had come across only two unsolved misper cases, neither of which involved a woman, young or old. And Stan had found nothing up to &#x2019;75. Maybe Nance would have better luck with the Police National Computer. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mackie handed the skull back to the SOCO.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Dr. Mackie, sir?&#x201d; shouted the other SOCO, scraping around the exposed ribcage.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist found himself on hands and knees, leaning into the grave.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It looks like a metal case, sir.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Camera,&#x201d; ordered Mackie. He flapped a hand to his side. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The SOCO by the plastic bags obliged.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The camera flashed as Mackie pried more soil loose and eased a rusted lump of metal from the rotted remains of clothing. &#x201c;Ah-hah,&#x201d; he said, holding it to his face. &#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;ve found ourselves a cigarette lighter.&#x201d; Mackie rubbed the lighter&#x2019;s rusted surface with his thumb, holding it as if about to light up. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t suppose it works,&#x201d; he said.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mackie reached for a metal box beside the moss-covered headstone and removed a magnifying glass. He turned his attention to the lighter. &#x201c;Looks as if there&#x2019;s some marks here,&#x201d; he mumbled. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s scratched on the side. Difficult to say. Could be damage to the case, of course. Or just natural deterioration.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;May I?&#x201d; asked Gilchrist.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The case was about three inches long by two wide, scarred black[KH3]&nbsp; with rust. Gilchrist supposed it had been silver-coated at one time. He studied it through the magnifier and tried to make sense of the markings, but the metal was too rusted. &#x201c;It could be anything,&#x201d; he said, and handed the magnifying glass and lighter back to Mackie. &#x201c;Can you clean it up?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to know if it means anything. You never know.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Let me see what I can come up with.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gilchrist thanked Mackie and stepped from the tent.&amp;n...</p><h2>Lola en la biblioteca</h2><p>Spanish language edition.<br>Lola has a big smile on her face.

The woman, now seated facing a grille, had been in conversation with the abbess for some forty-five minutes.<br><br>&#x201c;Grief is not an event, my dear, but a passage, a pilgrimage along a path that allows us to reflect upon the past from points of remembrance held in the soul. At times the way is filled with stones underfoot and we feel pained by our memories, yet on other days the shadows reflect our longing and those happinesses shared.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman nodded. &#x201c;I just wish there were not this doubt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uncertainty is sure to follow in such circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But how do I put my mind at rest, Dame Constance?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, you have not changed, have you?&#x201d; observed the abbess. &#x201c;Always seeking to do rather than to be. Do you really seek the counsel of the spirit?&#x201d;<br><br>The woman began to press down her cuticles with the thumbnail of the opposite hand.<br><br>&#x201c;I know I missed just about every one of your tutorials when I was at Girton, but I thought...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That I could help you find peace?&#x201d; Dame Constance paused, took a pencil and small notebook from a pocket within the folds of her habit and scribbled on a piece of paper. &#x201c;Sometimes help takes the form of directing. And peace is something we find when we have a companion on the journey. Here&#x2019;s someone who will help you. Indeed, you have common ground, for she was at Girton too, though she came later, in 1914, if my memory serves me well.&#x201d;<br><br>She passed the folded note through the grille.<br><br><em>Scotland Yard, London, Wednesday, December 31st, 1930</em><br>&#x201c;So you see, madam, there&#x2019;s very little more I can do in the circumstances, which are pretty cut and dried, as far as we&#x2019;re concerned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;ve made that abundantly clear, Detective Inspector Stratton.&#x201d; The woman sat bolt upright on her chair, brushing back her hair with an air of defiance. For a mere second she looked at her hands, rubbing an ink stain on calloused skin where her middle finger always pressed against the nib of her fountain pen. &#x201c;However, I cannot stop searching because your investigations have drawn nothing. To that end I have decided to enlist the services of a private inquiry agent.&#x201d;<br><br>The policeman, reading his notes, rolled his eyes, then looked up. &#x201c;That is your prerogative, of course, though I am sure his findings will mirror our own.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a he, it&#x2019;s a she.&#x201d; The woman smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;May I inquire as to the name of the &#x2018;she&#x2019; in question?&#x201d; asked Stratton, though he had already guessed the answer.<br><br>&#x201c;A Miss Maisie Dobbs. She&#x2019;s been highly recommended.&#x201d;<br><br>Stratton nodded. &#x201c;Indeed, I&#x2019;m familiar with her work. She&#x2019;s honest and knows her business. In fact, we have consulted with her here at Scotland Yard.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman leaned forward, intrigued. &#x201c;Really? Not like your boys to admit to needing help, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Stratton inclined his head, adding, &#x201c;Miss Dobbs has certain skills, certain... methods, that seem to bear fruit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would it be overstepping the mark if I asked what you know of her, her background? I know she was at Girton College a few years after me, and I understand she was a nurse in the war, and was herself wounded in Flanders.&#x201d;<br><br>Stratton looked at the woman, gauging the wisdom of sharing his knowledge of the private investigator. At this point it was in his interests to have the woman out of his hair, so he would do and say what was necessary to push her onto someone else&#x2019;s patch. &#x201c;She was born in Lambeth, went to work in service when she was thirteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In service?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let that put you off. Her intelligence was discovered by a friend of her employer, a brilliant man, an expert in legal medicine and himself a psychologist. When she came back from Flanders, as far as I know, she convalesced, then worked for a year in a secure institution, nursing profoundly shell-shocked men. She completed her education, spent some time studying at the Department of Legal Medicine in Edinburgh and went to work as assistant to her mentor. She learned her business from the best, if I am to be honest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s never married? How old is she, thirty-two, thirty-three?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, something like that. And no, she&#x2019;s never married, though I understand her wartime sweetheart was severely wounded.&#x201d; He tapped the side of his head. &#x201c;Up here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; The woman paused, then held out her hand. &#x201c;I wish I could say thank you for all that you&#x2019;ve done Inspector. Perhaps Miss Dobbs will be able to shed light where you have seen nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Stratton stood up, shook hands to bid the woman good-bye and called for a constable to escort her from the building. As soon as the door was closed, while reflecting that they had not even wished each other a cordial Happy New Year, he picked up the telephone receiver and placed a call.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br><br>Stratton leaned back in his chair. &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ll be pleased to hear that I&#x2019;ve got rid of that bloody woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. How did you manage that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A fortuitous move on her part&#x2014;she&#x2019;s going to a private investigator.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone I should worry about?&#x201d;<br><br>Stratton shook his head. &#x201c;Nothing I can&#x2019;t handle. I can keep an eye on her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, her.&#x201d;<br><br><em>Fitzroy Square, London, Wednesday, January 7th, 1931</em><br>Snow had begun to fall once again in small, harsh flakes that swirled around the woman as she emerged from Conway Street into Fitzroy Square. She pulled her fur collar up around her neck and thought that, even though she did not care for hats, she should have worn one this morning. There were those who would have suggested that the almost inconsequential lack of judgment was typical of her, and that she probably wanted to draw attention to herself, what with that thick copper-colored hair cascading in damp waves across her shoulders&#x2014;and no thought for propriety. But the truth was that, despite drawing glances wherever she went, on this occasion, rather like yesterday morning, and the morning before, she really didn&#x2019;t want to be seen. Well, not until she was ready, anyway.<br><br>She crossed the square, walking with care lest she slip on slush-covered flagstones, then halted alongside iron railings that surrounded the winter-barren garden. The inquiry agent Dame Constance had instructed&#x2014;yes, instructed her to see, for when the abbess spoke, there was never a mere suggestion&#x2014;worked from a room in the building she now surveyed. She had been told by the investigator&#x2019;s assistant that she should come to the first-floor office at nine on Monday morning. When she had canceled the appointment, he had calmly suggested the same time on the following day. And when, at the last minute, she had canceled the second appointment, he simply moved the time by twenty-four hours. She was intrigued that an accomplished woman with a growing reputation would employ a man with such a common dialect. In fact, such flight in the face of convention served as reassurance in her decision to follow the direction of Dame Constance. She had, after all, never set any stock by convention.<br><br>It was as she paced back and forth in front of the building, wondering whether today she would have the courage to see Maisie Dobbs&#x2014;and lack of pluck wasn&#x2019;t something that had dogged her in the past&#x2014;that she looked up and saw a woman in the first-floor office, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window looking out across the square. There was something about this woman that intrigued her. There she was, simply contemplating the square, her gaze directed at first up to the leafless trees, then at a place in the distance.<br><br>Sweeping a lock of windblown hair from her face, the visitor continued to watch the woman at the window. She wondered if that was her way, if that window was her place to stand and think. She suspected it was. It struck her that the woman in the window was the person she had come to see, Maisie Dobbs. Shivering again, she pushed her hands deep inside the copious sleeves of her coat, and began to turn away. But then, as if commanded to do so by a force she could feel but not see, she looked up at the window once more. Maisie Dobbs was staring directly at her now, and raising her hand in a manner so compelling that the visitor could not leave, could do nothing but meet the other woman&#x2019;s eyes in return. And in that moment, as Maisie Dobbs captured her with her gaze, she...</strong></p></p><h2>The Great Pig Search</h2><p>A postcard from Florida with a mysterious one-word message&#x2014;OINK!&#x2014;is the only clue to the whereabouts of the pigs that ran away from Bert and Ethel in The Great Pig Escape.

On a sunny day in Hollywood, a gleaming Rolls-Royce convertible pulls through the gates of the magnificent estate known as The Cottage. Modeled after the &#34;cottages&#34; of Newport, Rhode Island, the spacious, elegant property, sitting on fourteen acres of lush Bel Air, fits its owner to a T. For the man behind the wheel of the Rolls is Hollywood&#39;s ageless wonder, Cooper Winslow. A star of the silver screen for decades, a man whose allure to women is the stuff of legend, Coop exudes grace, charm, and old-fashioned style. But today Coop Winslow is in for a major surprise. He&#39;s broke. And with no major roles coming his way, Coop is faced with the heartbreaking prospect of selling his beloved home of forty years, or at least renting out the gatehouse and part of the main house. A huge blow to Coop, whose debonair attitude allows him to escape reality much of the time. His new tenants, Mark Friedman and Jimmy O&#39;Connor, are busy coping with problems of their own. Mark&#39;s wife of sixteen years just walked out, and Jimmy recently lost his own wife to a devastating illness. But everything changes when Mark&#39;s teenage son and daughter move in. Suddenly, The Cottage is transformed, with music blasting from every corner, teenagers on skateboards crashing into vintage cars, and a never-ending parade of young starlets streaming in and out to visit Coop. But amid all the noise and the chaos, something unexpected is happening. Three men who never would have met are becoming friends...and each man finds himself changing in surprising ways, Coop most of all.</p><p></p><h2>God: A Good Father</h2><p>Deep within every human heart lies a created hunger for the heavenly mountains of God&#39;s presence.

Tim Brookes's cultural history of the instrument is moved along by a personal narrative: a description of the six months in which a master luthier built Brookes his first custom guitar. It's a tad surprising that this very American story is told in a British accent (he's an ex-pat living in Vermont), but Brookes is the perfect reader for his own material--passionate, knowledgeable, and funny. There are some unnecessary tangents and tenuous arguments, but Brookes has a musician's ear for storytelling, a dry sense of humor, and some terrific turns of phrase.

Ellis traces Maurin's life from his early years--as peasant, brother, and Catholic activist--through his meeting with Dorothy Day. Ellis' Chronicle focuses on the consequences of that meeting: the founding of the Catholic Worker movement and newspaper, the founding of hospitality, the farming communes. <i>Peter Maurin: Prophet in the Twentieth Century</i> is the first biography to really examine Maurin's thought. A commitment to non-violent reform and to a life of poverty were chief tenets of Maurin's philosophy; it was Maurin's notion that farmers and scholars would labor and learn together in the ideal world. Ellis discusses these and other ideas of Maurin, their development and their particular importance today.

Burgess (<i>Seize the Trident</i>) recounts the stories of the political and business figures who supported these pirates and their voyages of plunder and murder, describing how the colonial governors in North America and the West Indies engaged in pirate brokering, selling privateering commissions that legitimized the armed seizure of treasure-laden ships as far away as the Red Sea. This was effectively state-sponsored piracy, and everyone profited from it&#x2014;everyone except the English Crown, that is. An engaging story wonderfully told with solid research.

Includes a biographical essay and a review of the Lumiere autochrome photographic process. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>In 1978 Davies, a University of Leeds England lecturer in Russian studies, happened on these 80 color and 30 black-and-white photographs taken by Russian writer Andreyev between 1910 and 1914. Mostly portraits of family and friends, the pictures suggest the halcyon comforts of life at Andreyev's dacha on the Gulf of Finland, where he played with his son, went boating on Distant One , his yacht, entertained and wrote late into the night. More than a few are self-por traits of a somewhat self-conscious hero deep in thought. A man of many hobbies, the writer remarked, "If I were Tsar, I'd make everyone take up photography"; Andreyev's "lack of moderation was his chief characteristic . . . he was drawn to everything colossal," attested a friend. Readers will be charmed by his love of a fledgling art and his "soft and impressionable" soul, which responded with affection to the beauties of landscape and the pleasures of home and travel ("We went out of town to the Via Appia today, but the wind was so strong and there was so much dust from the cars that Anichka sneezed all her innards out.") <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ninth: Beethoven and the World in 1824</h2><p>&#x201c;All men become brothers . . . <br>Be embraced, ye millions!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Ninth Symphony, a symbol of freedom and joy, was Beethoven&#x2019;s mightiest attempt to help humanity find its way from darkness to light, from chaos to peace. Yet the work was born in a repressive era, with terrified Bourbons, Hapsburgs, and Romanovs using every means at their disposal to squelch populist rumblings in the wake of the French Revolution and Napoleon&#x2019;s wars. Ironically, the premiere of this hymn to universal brotherhood took place in Vienna, the capital of a nation that Metternich was turning into the first modern police state.<br><br>The Ninth&#x2019;s unveiling, on May 7, 1824, was the most significant artistic event of the year, and the work remains one of the most precedent-shattering and influential compositions in the history of music&#x2014;a reference point and inspiration that resonates even today. But in The Ninth, eminent music historian Harvey Sachs demonstrates that Beethoven was not alone in his discontent with the state of the world. Lord Byron died in 1824 during an attempt to free Greece from the domination of the Ottoman empire; Delacroix painted a masterpiece in support of that same cause; Pushkin, suffering at the hands of an autocratic czar, began to draft his anti-authoritarian play Boris Godunov; and Stendhal and Heine wrote works that mocked conventional ways of thinking.<br><br>The Ninth Symphony was so unorthodox that it amazed and confused listeners at its premiere&#x2014;described by Sachs in vibrant detail&#x2014;yet it became a standard for subsequent generations of creative artists, and its composer came to embody the Romantic cult of genius. In this unconventional, provocative new book, Beethoven&#x2019;s masterwork becomes a prism through which we may view the politics, aesthetics, and overall climate of the era.<br><br>Part biography, part history, part memoir,<b> The Ninth</b> brilliantly explores the intricacies of Beethoven&#x2019;s last symphony&#x2014;how it brought forth the power of the individual while celebrating the collective spirit of humanity.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Harvey Sachs is a writer and music historian and the author or co-author of eight previous books, of which there have been more than fifty editions in fifteen languages. He has written for <i>The New Yorker </i>and many other publications, has been a Guggenheim Fellow and a Fellow of the New York Public Library&#x2019;s Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers, and is currently on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He lives in New York City.<br>&nbsp;Starred Review. Beethoven wasn't always a cultural icon. At least one critic attending the 1824 premiere of his Symphony No. 9 in D Minor likened what he heard to a hideously writhing wounded dragon. Just why the composer and his works endure is the question behind this absorbing book by music historian Sachs (<i>Toscanini</i>). Through detailed musical analysis and condensed readings of cultural politics and 19th-century history, Sachs ponders what role so-called high culture played, plays, and ought to play in civilization. Using the year 1824 and the premiere of the Ninth as ground zero, Sachs reviews the literary, artistic, and social movements of the time, noting how Beethoven's innovative symphony (the first with a vocal score) and its themes of equality and redemption no doubt challenged the resurgent conservatism among Europe's monarchies. Sachs places Beethoven alongside Pushkin, Byron, and other prominent romantics, whose talents he finds linked to a common quest for freedoms&#x2014;political, artistic, and above all of the mind and spirit. After first presenting the Ninth as a Viennese social event and then as emblematic of Beethoven's artistic process, Sachs shines with a close reading of the Ninth's musical score, interpreting its techniques and emotive narrative. Readers will want a recording nearby. In the book's last chapter, Sachs deals with the impact and legacy of Beethoven's masterwork and explains what makes his music universal. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through a focused reading of Heidegger's texts, and especially his late and often overlooked <em>Four Seminars</em> (1966-1973), Richard Capobianco counters this trend by redirecting attention to the centrality of the name of Being in Heidegger's lifetime of thought.</p><p>Capobianco gives special attention to Heidegger's resonant terms <em>Ereignis</em> and <em>Lichtung</em> and reads them as saying and showing the very same fundamental phenomenon named &#x2018;Being itself &#x2019;. Written in a clear and approachable manner, the essays in <em>Engaging Heidegger</em> examine Heidegger's thought in view of ancient Greek, medieval, and Eastern thinking, and they draw out the deeply humane character of his &#x2018;meditative thinking.&#x2019;</p></p><p>Richard Capobianco is Professor and Chair in the Philosophy department at Stonehill College.Advance Praise for 'Engaging Heidegger': <br>"'Engaging Heidegger' is truly a pleasure to read. With impeccable scholarship and remarkable lucidity, Richard Capobianco combines an appreciation of Heidegger's speculative depth with an evaluation that evinces solid common sense and a thoughtful, humane outlook." <br>Richard Velkley, Department of Philosophy, Tulane University<br><br>"In a very valid sense, then, Capobianco's readings add up to what may legitimately be called an engaging of the 'whole' Heidegger....&nbsp; Taken in sum, these essays shine by reason of the thoroughness of their textual foundation, the clarity of their presentation, and the simplicity of their relatively jargon-free style."<br>From the Foreword by William J.

Denunciations thundered from speaker&#39;s platforms around the US and Europe. One open letter to The Times was signed by 11 peers, 19 bishops and 75 MPs. Viscount Grey, Britain&#39;s foreign secretary, declared that no overseas issue had so intensely aroused the British public for 30 years. Conan Doyle wrote a pamphlet on the Congo atrocities which sold 25,000 copies in the first week alone.

Even so, he searched the globe to find a colony for Belgium, frantic that the scramble of other European powers for overseas dominions in Africa and Asia would leave nothing for himself or his people. When he eventually found a suitable location in what would become the Belgian Congo, later known as Zaire and now simply as Congo, Leopold set about establishing a rule of terror that would culminate in the deaths of 4 to 8 million indigenous people, "a death toll," Hochschild writes, "of Holocaust dimensions." Those who survived went to work mining ore or harvesting rubber, yielding a fortune for the Belgian king, who salted away billions of dollars in hidden bank accounts throughout the world. Hochschild's fine book of historical inquiry, which draws heavily on eyewitness accounts of the colonialists' savagery, brings this little-studied episode in European and African history into new light. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Adam Hochschild teaches writing at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.

Her latest offers up another richly drawn locale&#x2014;the sunburned landscape of 19th-century Morocco&#x2014;but also a rather stale romance between Abigail Merchant, a naï¿½ve, book-smart librarian from Boston, and secretive Apollo Smith, a savvy adventurer with a habit of attracting danger. The two meet en route to Morocco when Apollo nurses a seasick Abigail back to health. Variations on this encounter recur throughout, with Apollo saving Abigail from thieves, depraved legionnaires, scorpions, suspicious nomads and, eventually, her own ignorance as they travel toward Timbuktu in search of the Great Library of Alexandria. Aside from the occasional lustful look, the two primarily exchange wimpy barbs. Though more than a few romances have evolved from less, their relationship is particularly unbelievable since Abigail never outgrows her role as priggish, self-righteous librarian. Bookended by an abrupt, unlikely intro and an extraneous epilogue, this romance is bland fare despite its exotic locale. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.*Starred Review* American librarian Abigail Merchant intended to dazzle her misogynistic new employers at the British Museum with her skills in rare book and manuscript preservation. Instead, she is stuck in a dark, dreary basement cataloging a seemingly endless array of books sent to the museum for copyright acquisition. Then one day while navigating through the literary flotsam and jetsam, Abigail discovers an overlooked treasure: a collection of books and papers donated by eccentric scholar T. Thaddeus Chilton. Convinced that Chilton found the key to the location of the remains of the Library of Alexandria, Abigail "borrows" Chilton's papers and sets off for Africa. It is only after arriving in Morocco that Abigail comes to the conclusion that in spite of the extensive number of books she has read, she might just need infuriating and way too sexy for his own good ex-legionnaire Apollo Smith and his "unique" skills if she wants to succeed in finding the legendary library. Krahn's latest wonderfully creative historical is itself a treasure: an irresistible blend of impeccably crafted characters, an adventure-rich plot set in North Africa, and wickedly dry humor. <i>John Charles</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Ariadne is the young princess who helps Theseus defeat the Minotaur; it's her thread that guides him back through the twists and treachery of the labyrinth. The myth has always focused on Theseus as hero; in fact (except for those familiar with Strauss' opera <i>Ariadne</i><i> aux Naxos</i>), most of us can't remember who Ariadne is. Now Orgel puts Ariadne center stage and lets her tell the story from the beginning. Always a rebel, she hates her cruel father, King Minos of Crete, who keeps the Minotaur imprisoned in the labyrinth and feeds him on human flesh. Then Theseus arrives, one of the 14 Athenians who are the required annual tribute to the monster. Dazzled by Theseus' beauty, power, and attention, Ariadne loves him and helps him; she leaves home and sails away with him--and then wakes up to find that he has abandoned her on an island. Ariadne tells her story with simple drama, and the book design is spacious and beautiful. Moser's watercolors, however, are sunlit and idyllic, with little sense of the darkness and terror that are also part of the story. His full-front view of the Minotaur is a mistake, maybe because it jars our own images; it's not nearly as compelling as his woodcuts for <i>Frankenstein</i> (1984), which kept the monster mysterious and distanced. What is heartrending is the view of Ariadne on the shore, searching the horizon for a sail, waiting for Theseus to return. This version of the story shakes you up. Theseus is undoubtedly a hero who sacrifices himself for others; does he deliberately mislead Ariadne? The treachery is a shock, but just as astonishing is the way that Ariadne recovers from her pain and finds love and joy with the god Dionysus. Orgel shows that the young woman's perilous journey is also a personal one of leaving home and transforming herself. <i>Hazel Rochman</i>Grade 6-9-A prologue sets the stage for readers: King Minos angered the god Poseidon and as punishment saw his wife enamoured of a bull. She died at the birth of the product of that union: the Minotaur, now immured and fed an annual sacrifice of Athenian youth. This fictionalized, first-person narrative begins with 10-year-old Ariadne as she tries to approach her monstrous half-brother, only to learn a brutal lesson about his-and her father's-nature. The core story begins five years later, as Ariadne watches the Greek prince Theseus arrive to be sacrificed- and instantly falls in love with him. In quick order she helps him escape, is abandoned on Naxos, and is rescued from despair by a satyr who introduces her to Dionysus (who in turn introduces her to wine). The god marries her on the spot, just after spelling out the lesson of the tale: "Even love that ends in pain and grief is precious as a stop along the way toward greater love." Who could quarrel with this consoling moral, even if Ariadne's rebound is rather precipitous? The prolific Moser gets better and better, though his bull-headed Minotaur is more pathetic than terrifying. Minos looks like a Viking, but Theseus and Dionysus clearly represent opposing male types. Ariadne, with her button-nose and straggling red locks, doesn't look much like a Cretan or a princess, but perhaps the idea is that the young teenage target audience will identify with the face above the flowing robes. The emotional heroine, and the romantic and sexual themes, may make this myth material more than palatable to middle-school readers.<br><i>Patricia Dooley, formerly at University of Washington, Seattle</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beyond Isabella: Secular Women Patrons of Art in Renaissance Italy (Sixteenth Century Essays &amp; Studies)</h2><p><p>Who were the secular female patrons of art and architecture in Renaissance Italy beyond Isabella d&#x2019;Este? This volume brings together fourteen essays which examine the important and often unrecognized roles aristocratic and bourgeois women played in the patronage of visual culture during the Italian Renaissance. Themes include the significance of role models for female patrons, the dynamics of conjugal patronage, and the widespread patronage activities of widows.</p><p>Collectively, the essays demonstrate how resourceful women expressed themselves through patronage despite the limitations of a highly structured patriarchal society. Thus, Isabella d&#x2019;Este was by no means unique as a secular female patron, and the studies offered here should encourage scholars to move further &#x2018;beyond Isabella&#x2019; in their assessment of women&#x2019;s patronage of art and architecture in Renaissance Italy.</p></p><p><p>Sheryl E.

He is the author of two of the most popular detective series of the past decade, featuring Alex Cross and the Women's Murder Club, and he also writes nonfiction and The Maximum Ride series for young readers. Read on to see James Patterson's questions for Patricia Cornwell, or turn the tables to see what Cornwell asked Patterson.</p> <p> <strong>Patterson</strong>: Here's a chance to say all the great things the critics would about <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>, if there were any newspapers left that still reviewed books. Or, as they say in the TV interviews: Tell us about this one, Patricia. <br></p> <p><strong>Cornwell</strong>: As was true in the last book (<em>Scarpetta</em>), the new one is set in New York City, and it begins with Kay Scarpetta working on the autopsy of a young woman who presumably was murdered the night before in Central Park. While the apparent circumstances of the violent crime say one thing, the body is telling Scarpetta a very different and incredibly disturbing story that causes the prosecutor, the police, other officials, and even Scarpetta's friends and colleagues, to wonder if she's making mistakes or has begun to believe her own legend. While others are questioning and criticizing her, she begins to doubt herself and her decision to be the senior forensic analyst for CNN&#x2014;an exposure that possibly leads to her BlackBerry disappearing and a suspicious package being left for her at her apartment building. As the intrigue unfolds, the past is no longer past, and she is soon faced with an old nemesis who threatens to be her final undoing.</p> <strong>Patterson</strong>: This book is set in New York again&#x2014;what do you like about the Big City? What don't you like? <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: Certainly New York City is the ultimate Big City. By placing Scarpetta in the midst of NYC within its medical examiner's office, I've positioned her on an international stage where anything can and does happen. The machinery is huge (NYPD and the FBI field office, for example), yet the private lives of the characters remain intimate and small. Not only is this a big story about a big-city case that captivates the world, it's also a very close look at the characters and who and what they are to one another in contemporary times. In terms of what I like and don't like about NYC? The only thing I don't like about it is driving there. <br><br><strong>Patterson</strong>: I often get asked what I have in common with Alex Cross. What would you say you have in common with Kay Scarpetta? <br><br><strong>Cornwell</strong>: Scarpetta and I share the same values and sensibilities. We approach cases the same way (which should be rather obvious, since I work the cases by taking on her persona). Beyond that, there are many differences. I'm not Catholic or Italian or married to Benton Wesley. I'm not a forensic pathologist with a law degree. I don't have her emotional discipline or inhibitions, nor do I have her professional dazzle. (I always remind people I was an English major who started working at age eleven, first as a babysitter, then in food service!) I don't have Scarpetta's pedigree. But then, she isn't a writer, unless she's writing professional journal articles or autopsy reports. <strong><br><br>Patterson</strong>: What's your routine like when it comes to writing? Do you do write every day? On the road? Do you need vacations from your writing? <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: I wish I had more of a routine. I begin each book with research that continues up to the very end of the process. But gradually, as I approach the deadline, I sink deeper into seclusion until eventually I don&#x2019;t even answer e-mails or the phone anymore (unless it's my partner, Staci). I just write morning, noon, and night. The pulling together and completion of a novel is so intense, I'm almost living out of body by the time I'm done. It's the most wonderful and miserable experience imaginable. I would love a vacation but never seem to have time, and I doubt I'd know what to do if you made me "do nothing." In fact, Staci and I have a strange habit of going to foreign lands and visiting their police departments and morgues instead of just hanging out at the beach. I don't write every day because I do so much research, and currently, I have many other responsibilities that keep me busier than ever (filming, involvement with forensic institutes&#x2014;just the business of life, for example). <strong><br><br>Patterson</strong>: What's the best feedback you've had from a reader? Or&#x2014;what was the best piece of writing advice you've had? <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: Frankly, the best feedback was when a reader complained some years ago that he wasn&#x2019;t sure I liked my characters anymore. And I thought about this and realized I wasn&#x2019;t sure I did, either. A horrible thing to realize. It was because the series had gone on for so long that it was time to reinvent the characters and their relationships with one another and the world they inhabit. I think this remake is most apparent in the last book, <em>Scarpetta</em>, and I am on a wonderful and invigorating new course that is even more evident in the new one, <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>. <strong><br><br>Patterson</strong>: Bonus question: How do you feel about the Hollywood adaptations of your work? Don't be afraid&#x2014;let it all hang out. <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: In the past, very disappointed, because the projects went nowhere. Now, so far so good. The first films (<em>Lifetime </em>movies of <em>At Risk</em> and <em>The Front</em>, which are non-Scarpetta novellas) air this spring. I had a magnificent experience from beginning to end with the producers, actors&#x2014;everyone. It's way too early to talk about the 20th Century Fox project with Angelina Jolie, although who wouldn't be excited about her? <br><br><b> Patricia Cornwell</b> is the former Director of Applied Forensic Science at the National Forensic Academy, and a member of the Harvard&#x2014;affiliated McLean Hospital's National Council, where she is an advocate for psychiatric research.

It is a tale of mysticism, sexual scandals, religious fervor and chicanery, out of which emerged one of the most influential thinkers of modern times. Krishnamurti was "discovered" as a young boy on a beach in India by members of the Theosophical Society, convinced that they had found the new world leader, a spiritual savior as historic and as influential as Jesus himself. By the 1920s he was attracting worldwide press attention and people flocked to his talks in the thousands. In 1922, Krishnamurti broke with the society and set out on a teaching mission of his own as a secular philosopher of spirituality. He ultimately had a career that spanned six decades, founded seven schools, published 50 books and encompassed thousands of talks. This extraordinary story is told for the first time by Roland Vernon in the full light of 20th-century attitudes in a narrative that is as compelling as any novel.<br></p><p>Roland Vernon's biography of Krishnamurti, subtitled <i>The Invention of a Messiah</i>, could also have been called simply <i>Understanding the Man</i>. Krishnamurti's life has been well chronicled, but Vernon keeps his sights on the people and events that shaped Krishnamurti's life. We learn about Charles Leadbeater, the allegedly pedophilic discoverer of and tutor to Krishnamurti; Annie Besant, the notorious social activist and Krishnamurti's second mother; and the mysterious and painful "process" that brought Krishnamurti to enlightenment. Besides the influences on his public persona, Vernon is also fascinated by the sometimes contradictory and less well-known private side of Krishnamurti. He had close ties to his brother Nitya, whose death galvanized Krishnamurti to forsake the organization that created him. And he carried on an extended clandestine affair with Rosalind Williams Rajagopal, his early companion and later wife of his friend and business partner. Not quick to pass judgment, Vernon looks at various perspectives of these people and events, unafraid finally to come down with his own well-reasoned opinions. <i>Star in the East</i> depicts Krishnamurti as a complex man who encouraged everyone to think for themselves. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><b>Roland Vernon</b> lives in Somerset, England with his wife and children.

"For as long as I can remember, I have loved to mix up words and phrases into silly little combinations that would make me laugh," he explains. "I&#x2019;d make up songs while meandering down the outer beach of Cape Cod to favorite fishing spots, and &#x2018;Frog Belly Rat Bone&#x2019; was always a favorite string of nouns. Then one day in Pasadena, I sat at a tiny picnic table in the children&#x2019;s garden and began to sketch the garden&#x2019;s scarecrow. I knew at that moment that Frog Belly Rat Bone had found a home." Timothy Basil Ering&#x2019;s artwork has appeared in books, magazines, theater sets, private murals, and fine art galleries. A resident of Somerville, Massachusetts, he is enamored of the sea and has a passion for nature and the outdoors. This is his first picture book with Candlewick Press.K-Gr. 2. Welcome to Cementland, "a dull, gray, endless place" of ruined buildings, exposed plumbing, and things in corners that nobody really wants to see. In that gloomy land dwells a special boy who finds a treasure. But it is one thing to find a treasure and quite another to keep it when thieves are around. To protect the loot, the boy (a round-headed, neckless stick figure) builds a creature from wire; wet, smelly socks; and other things at hand. And so is born Frog Belly Rat Bone, and before kids can say "junkyard dog," Cementland is transformed into a garden of Eden. The story is both predictable and a tad didactic, but the art and the design are extraordinary. Ering's combination of hand-lettered text and scribbly, muddy, scratchy pictures looks like a collaboration between Tim Burton and Ralph Steadman (in a good mood). Even better, the book's covers are embossed to offer tactile pleasures that the textured inside art only implies. Children will skim the story, but savor the art. <i>Michael Cart</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Priests, deacons, and students of theology will find these articles an engaging means to understanding Church, ministry, and priesthood more deeply.</p> <p><i>The Theology of Priesthood</i> includes ten essays that explore facets of ordained ministry and the ministerial priesthood. Paul Philibert, OP, begins with an overview of issues involved in the contemporary discussion on priesthood within the Roman Catholic tradition. Frank Quinn, OP, addresses the significance of language as it pertains to priesthood and ministry and how language is manifested in rites of ordination. Thomas O'Meara, OP, situates the discussion on priesthood within the context of an expansion of ministry in the Church since Vatican II and the implications of this expansion for ministry in the future.</p> <p>Stephen DeLeers articulates a theology of priesthood grounded in Vatican II and post-Vatican II documents which focuses on the primacy of preaching. Thomas Rausch, SJ, then takes up the issue of diversity within ministerial priesthood as he reflects on priesthood within the context of apostolic religious life. Jack Risley, OP, returns to the question of the relationship between ordained ministry and lay ministry.</p> <p>The final three articles reflect on ordained ministry from distinctive perspectives. Benedict Ashley, OP, takes the Letter to the Hebrews as his starting point. Paul Wesche looks at priesthood through the lens of an Eastern Orthodox priest. Donald Goergen, OP, asks what insights African theology, specifically African Christology, might offer a contemporary Catholic theology of priesthood. Paul Philibert, OP, provides a concluding reflection.</p> <p><i>Donald J. Goergen, OP, is a preacher, teacher, lecturer, author, and theologian who taught systematic theology for many years.

The latter, which has been produced in England occasionally since the 1950s, is considered to be among Firbank&#39;s major works, and yet it, like the other two plays, has not been generally available in this country until now. The plays are filled with the wit and satire for which Firbank&#39;s novels are relished; indeed, Firbank&#39;s novels relied so heavily on dialogue that the distinction between them and his plays is minimal. Consequently, those who enjoy his novels and stories - as well as those who enjoy the comic British theater tradition of Pinero, Wilde, and Coward - should welcome this collection. Steven Moore, who edited the Complete Short Stories, has written an introduction placing the plays in the context of Firbank&#39;s life.</p><p><p>British novelist Ronald Firbank was born in London, the son of society lady Harriet Jane Garrett and MP Sir Thomas Firbank. He went to Uppingham School, and then on to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He converted to Catholicism in 1907. In 1909 he left Cambridge, without completing a degree. Living off his inheritance he travelled around Spain, Italy, the Middle East, and North Africa. Ronald Firbank died of lung disease while in Rome.</p>The principal English bearer of camp sensibility between Wilde and Coward, Firbank (1886-1926) is most famous for eight arch novels. He also wrote two one-act plays and <i>The Princess Zoubaroff</i> in three acts. The earliest,<i> The Mauve Tower,</i> is juvenilia, interesting only in that it seems inspired by Wilde's <i>Salom{&#x201a;}e</i>. The second, <i>A Disciple from the Country</i>, written when Firbank was 21, comically depicts fashionable people espousing religion for utterly vain reasons; in it, a debutante styles herself "the Saint" in order to snare men and also attracts an old woman who comes to be blessed. The camp characteristic of being enthusiastic about serious things for the wrong reasons--all there is thematically to <i>Disciple</i>--also animates <i>Zoubaroff</i>. But the long play has, besides trivializing religion, the object of ridiculing marriage; although not stating it in so many words, the play implies that all marriages are sexually fraudulent and the most desirable social state would be one of homosexual separatism. <i>Disciple</i> offers just enough glib superciliousness to be utterly amusing; <i>Zoubaroff</i>, though it has its moments, rather too much. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>MKSAP (R) 17 Gastroenterology and Hepatology</h2><p>The 17th edition of Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program (MKSAPï¿½ 17) is specifically intended for physicians who provide personal, nonsurgical care to adults.

Exploring such theatres as the Balkans, Africa and the Ottoman Empire, this single-volume work assesses Britain&#39;s participation in the light of what became a struggle for the defence of liberalism, and shows how the war shaped the &#34;short&#34; 20th century that followed it. Published to tie in with a television series, &#34;The First World War&#34; accompanies 10 one-hour episodes to be shown on Channel 4 during the autumn of 2003.</p><p>Professor Hew Strachan is the Chichele Professor of the History of War at Oxford University, and the author of several highly acclaimed books on military history.In Britain popular interest in the <i>First World War</i> runs at levels that surprise almost all other nations, with the possible exception of France. The concluding series of Blackadder, the enormously successful BBC satirization of the history of England, saw its heroes in the trenches. Its humour assumed an audience familiar with chï¿½teau-bound generals, goofy staff officers and cynical but long-suffering infantrymen. The notion that British soldiers were &#x2018;lions led by donkeys&#x2019; continues to provoke a debate that has not lost its passion, even if it is now devoid of originality. For a war that was global, it is a massively restricted vision: a conflict measured in yards of mud along a narrow corridor of Flanders and northern France. It knows nothing of the Italian Alps or of the Masurian lakes; it bypasses the continents of Africa and Asia; and it forgets the war&#x2019;s other participants &#x2013; diplomats and sailors, politicians and labourers, women and children. Casualty levels do not provide a satisfactory explanation for such insularity. British deaths in the First World War may have exceeded those of the Second, and Britain is unusual, if not unique, in this respect. The reverse is true for Germany and Russia, as it is for the United States. However, even losses of three-quarters of a million proved to be little more than a blip in demographic terms. The influenza epidemic that swept from Asia through Europe and America in 1918&#x2013;19 killed more people than the First World War. By the mid-1920s the population of Britain, like those of other belligerents, was recovering to its pre-war levels. In the crude statistics of rates of marriage and reproduction there was no &#x2018;lost generation&#x2019;.<p>But the British, and particularly the better educated classes, believed there was. The legacy of literature, and its effects on the shaping of memory, have proved far more influential than economic or political realities. In 1961, Benjamin Britten incorporated nine poems by Wilfred Owen in his War Requiem, which he dedicated to the memory of four friends who had been killed in 1914&#x2013;18. The work was first performed at the consecration of the Coventry Cathedral in 1962. The old cathedral was a casualty of the Second World War, not the First, but Britten was following an established pattern in conflating the commemoration of the two wars. Armistice Day for the First World War, 11 November 1918, and the act of remembrance on the nearest Sunday to it, was appropriated to honour the dead of 1939&#x2013;45. Today Remembrance Sunday embraces not only every subsequent war in which Britain has been engaged but also more general reflections on war itself, and on its cost in blood and suffering. The annual service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall is therefore deeply paradoxical. A ceremony weighted with nationalism, attended by the Queen and orchestrated as a military parade, bemoans wars fought in the nation&#x2019;s name. It cuts away war&#x2019;s triumphalism, and in the process seems to question the necessity of the very conflicts in which those it commemorates met their deaths.</p><p>Wilfred Owen himself embodied some of these paradoxes. Owen was killed in action on 4 November 1918: his mother did not receive the news until after the fighting was over. The war both did for Owen and made him. He returned to the front line when he could probably have avoided doing so, telling his mentor, Siegfried Sassoon, &#x2018;Serenity Shelley never dreamed of crowns me&#x2019;. The war gave him the material which transformed him into one of the greatest English poets of the twentieth century. For schoolchildren throughout Britain his verses are often their first and most profound encounter with the First World War. Niall Ferguson&#x2019;s interpretation of the conflict, The Pity of War, published on the occasion of the armistice&#x2019;s eightieth anniversary in 1998, used Owen&#x2019;s words in its title. But it is worth recalling what Owen makes explicit but his readers tend to overlook &#x2013; that his subject was war as a general phenomenon, more than the First World War in particular. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, that &#x2018;it is sweet and fitting to die for one&#x2019;s country&#x2019;, is, he insists, &#x2018;an old lie&#x2019;. By quoting Horace, Owen places himself along a continuum that embraces two millennia; he says little, if anything, about the peculiarities that explained the horrors of the war in which he himself served and died.</p><p>Owen did not achieve canonical status until the 1960s: Britten popularised him. The first edition of his poems, prepared by Sassoon in December 1920, sold 730 copies. A further 700 copies, printed in 1921, were still not sold out by 1929. By then the collected poems of another victim of the war, Rupert Brooke, had run to 300,000 copies. Brooke knew his Horace as well as Owen did, but for Brooke&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Soldier&#x2019; death in battle was both sweet and fitting. Of course Brooke&#x2019;s continuing popularity reflected in large measure the desire of wives and mothers, of parents and children, to find solace in their mourning. They needed the reassurance that their loss was not vain. But it makes another point &#x2013; that the First World War was capable of many interpretations, and that until at least the late 1920s those different meanings co-existed with each other. Every adult across Europe, and many in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australasia, had his or her own sense of the war&#x2019;s significance. The conviction that the war was both wasteful and futile was neither general nor even dominant.</p><p>When the great powers of Europe embarked on war in 1914 popular conceptions of combat were shaped more by the past than by prognostications of the future. The literature of warning, both popular and professional, was abundant. But hope prevailed over realism, and in truth the circumstances of the outbreak created little choice: for every nation the war seemed to be one of national self-defence, and the obligations on its citizens were therefore irrefutable. By December 1916 the nature of the war, its costs and casualties, and their threat of social upheaval, were self-evident. But even then none of the belligerents seized the opportunity of negotiation which the United States held out. The differences in values and ideologies look less stark than they seemed then only because we have been hardened by the later clashes between Fascism and Bolshevism, and between both of them and western liberalism. The very fact of the United States&#x2019;s entry into the war in April 1917 makes the point. Woodrow Wilson had been &#x2018;too proud to fight&#x2019;. He was deeply opposed to the use of war for the furtherance of policy, and the evidence of the battles of Verdun and the Somme in 1916 should have consolidated that belief. So when he took the United States into the war he laboured under few illusions as to the horrors which men like Wilfred Owen had experienced at first hand. But he concluded that the United States had to wage war if it was to shape the future of international relations. It may have been a vision which the Senate rejected in the war&#x2019;s immediate aftermath, but it still inspires American foreign policy.</p><p>This is of course the biggest paradox in our understanding of the war. On the one hand it was an unnecessary war fought in a manner that defied common sense, but on the other it was the war that shaped the world in which we still live. When the First World War began, historians, especially in Imperial Germany, identified a &#x2018;long&#x2019; nineteenth century, starting with the French Revolution in 1789 and ending in 1914. For their successors that was when the &#x2018;short&#x2019; twentieth century began, and it ended with the conclusion of the Cold War in 1990. The subsequent conflicts in the Balkans brought home to many the role played by the multinational Habsburg empire in keeping the lid on ethnic and cultural difference before 1914. Between 1917 and 1990 the Soviet Union&#x2019;s ideological confrontation with the west performed a not dissimilar function. But the Soviet Union was itself an heir of the First World War, the product of the Russian revolution. Its authoritarianism established a form of international order, especially in eastern Europe after 1945. The sort of localised war which had triggered world war in 1914 was suppressed precisely because of that precedent: the fear of a big war now contained and defused the dangers inherent in a small one. However, for eastern Europe there was another lesson from the First World War, and it was a very different one from that with which it is commonly associated in the west today. War was not futile. For the revolutionaries, as for the subject nationalities of the Habsburg empire, the war had delivered.</p><p>In the Middle East, the reverse applied. The war satisfied nobody. The British and French were given temporary control of large chunks of the former Ottoman empire, thus frustrating the ambitions of Arab independence. Moreover, contradictory promises were made in the process; in particular Arthur Balfour, the former British prime minister, declared that the Jews would find a homeland in Palestine. The roots of today&#x2019;s Middle Eastern conflict lie here.</p><p>The First World War solved some problems and created others; in doing so it was little different from any other war. The other major English-language work published on the eightieth anniversary of the armistice, John Keegan&#x2019;s The First World War, concluded that &#x2018;principle . . . scarcely merited the price eventually paid for its protection&#x2019;. This is the pay-off for his opening assertion: &#x2018;The First World War was an unnecessary and tragic conflict&#x2019;. Liberals with a small &#x2018;l&#x2019; say that of many wars, and with good reason. But is it really more true of the First World War than of any other war? And what do principles represent, if in the last resort they are not worth fighting for? We may wonder why the belligerents of 1914 were ready to endure so much, but we do so from the perspective of a new century and possessed of values that have themselves been shaped by the experience both of the First World War and of later wars. It behoves us to think as they did then, not as we do now.<br><br>1 To Arms<br><br>Austria-Hungary: An Empire under Threat<br>The weekend of 12&#x2013;14 June 1914 was a busy one at Konopischt, the hunting lodge and favourite home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Here he could indulge his passion for field sports, and here he and his wife, Sophie, could escape the stultifying conventions of the Habsburg court in Vienna. Although he was heir apparent to his aged uncle, Franz Josef, the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, his wife was treated according to the rank with which she had been born, that of an impoverished Czech aristocrat. On their marriage, Franz Ferdinand had been compelled to renounce royal privileges both for her and for their children. At court dinners she sat at the foot of the table, below all the archduchesses, however young; at a ball in 1909, an Austrian newspaper reported, &#x2018;the members of the Imperial House appeared in the Ballroom, each Imperial prince with a lady on his arm according to rank, whereas the wife of the Heir to the Throne was obliged to enter the room last, alone and without escort&#x2019;.1</p><p>Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were expecting two sets of guests, and got on well with both of them. The first, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, treated Sophie with a warmness that provided a refreshing contrast with Habsburg flummery. He had been under thirty when he ascended the throne in 1888, and his youth and vigour had inspired the hopes of a nation which saw itself as possessed of the same qualities. Germany was younger even than its ruler, having united under Prussia&#x2019;s leadership in 1871. By 1914, however, the paradoxes of Wilhelm&#x2019;s character, at once both conservative and radical, seemed to be manifestations of inconsistency rather than innovation. Born with a withered arm and blighted by an uncertain relationship with his English mother, a daughter of Queen Victoria, the Kaiser was a man of strong whims but minimal staying power. Ostensibly, he had come to admire Konopischt&#x2019;s garden; in reality, he and Franz Ferdinand discussed the situation in the Balkans.</p><p>This, the most backward corner of Europe, was where the First World War would begin. The problems it generated, which preoccupied Wilhelm and Franz Ferdinand, were not Germany&#x2019;s; they were Austria-Hungary&#x2019;s. Vienna, not Berlin, was to initiate the crisis that led to war. It did so with full deliberation, but the war it had in mind was a war in the Balkans, not a war for the world.</p><p>By 1914 Austria-Hungary had lost faith in the international order established at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, whose robustness had prevented major war on the continent for a century. For twenty years, between 1792 and 1815, Europe had been racked by wars waged at France&#x2019;s behest; they had challenged the old order, and they had promoted or even provoked nationalism and liberalism. For the Habsburg Empire, whose lands stretched from Austria south into Italy, and east into Hungary and Poland, and which claimed suzerainty over the states and principalities of Germany to the north, national self-determination threatened disintegration. In 1815 it therefore sponsored a settlement whose principles were conservative &#x2013; which used the restoration of frontiers to curb France and elevated the resulting international order to suppress nationalism and liberalism. Rather than run the risk of major war again, the great powers agreed to meet regularly thereafter. Although formal congresses rapidly became more intermittent, the spirit of the so-called Concert of Europe continued, even when it transpired that the forces of nationalism and liberalism could be moderated but not deflected. After the revolutions that broke out in much of Europe in 1848, war occurred more often. Conservatives realised that liberals did not have a monopoly on nationalism, although for the multi-national Austrian Empire the effect of nationalism remained divisive. In 1859 it lost its lands in Lombardy to the unification of Italy. Seven years later, it forfeited control of Germany to Prussia after the defeat at Kï¿½niggrï¿½tz, and in the aftermath it struck a deal with Hungary which acknowledged the latter&#x2019;s autonomy, recognising that the Emperor of Austria was also the King of Hungary. But, despite these challenges, the ideals of the Concert of Europe persisted. Wars remained short and contained. Even when Prussia invaded France in 1870 and emerged as the leader of a federal German state, the other powers did not intervene.</p><p>However, the writ of the 1815 system did not embrace Europe&#x2019;s south-eastern corner. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the entire Balkan peninsula, as far west as modern Albania and Bosnia and as far north as Romania, was part of the Ottoman Empire. From its capital in Constantinople, the Turks ruled the modern Middle East, with further territory in North Africa, Arabia and the Caucasus. As a result, many of the Balkan population were Muslim and therefore outside the purview of what the Tsar of Russia, in particular, had seen as a Christian alliance. Indeed, Russia itself had invaded the Balkans, and on the third occasion, in 1878, the representatives of the great powers convened in Berlin and recognised three independent Balkan states, Serbia, Montenegro and Romania, and expanded the frontiers of two more, Bulgaria and Greece. The Concert of Europe had put its seal on the decline of Ottoman power in t...</p></p><h2>Sepher Sapphires: A Treatise on Gematria - &#39;The Magical Language&#39; - Volume 1</h2><p>An advanced reference book of Kabbalistic Gematria, listing Hebrew numerological and mystical meanings for every number from 1 to 1,000.

They are visually rich and highly accurate references that will remain interesting, useful and current for many years. Offering a discerning insight into the relationship between garden plants and their natural environments and accuracy that is unequalled outside scientific circles, this duo are truly the modern heirs to a long history of botanical references. There are simply no other works of this kind available today. </p><p> <b>About Volume I, Trees and Shrubs</b> </p><p> Featuring 510 genera of temperate woody garden plants with full details of how they are related, their origins and uses, Volume I covers trees, shrubs and climbers. From plants dating to prehistory -- tree ferns, gingkoes and some conifers - to those more recently evolved, this volume includes early- flowering plants (magnolia and its family), catkin-bearing trees, fruit and nut trees, maples, the cordyline, palm and bamboo species, and many more advanced trees and shrubs. </p></p><p><p> <b>Roger Phillips</b> was trained as a painter at Chelsea School of Art.

The plant families are covered systematically, and the relationships between them are discussed; readers will be able to put the knowledge they have acquired piecemeal into a framework, and understand the botanical groups and the similarities and differences between them. </p><p> <b>Genera and plant evolution</b> </p><p> This book is based on the genus, genera in the plural, the Latin word for family, class, or race. Plants are classified in a hierarchy of many ranks, but the only three commonly used are family, genus, and species. To take an example, the black or water birch <i>Betula nigra</i> is a species in the genus <i>Betula</i> and the family <i>Betulaceae</i>. A genus is usually a very natural and familiar grouping, such as oak, beech, day-lily, or dahlia. Many genera are small and easily recognised by a combination of characteristics not found in another group of plants, for instance the green flowers, lobed leaves, and dry, winged seeds of <i>Liriodendron</i>, the tulip tree. Other genera are large, with tens or even hundreds of species, and can be further divided into subgenera; some botanists may consider these subgenera worthy of division into distinct genera, for example the division of <i>Cornus</i> into <i>Benthamidia</i>, <i>Chamaepericlymenum</i>, and <i>Swida</i>. Modern studies sometimes confirm these divisions, or sometimes show them to be artificial. The plant world can be imagined as a huge, chaotic, and multi-stemmed tree, branching repeatedly, with some branches dying, others thriving and waxing or waning in importance through the millenia. Some branches have survived almost unchanged for millions of years, others that were formerly very important have died out. A few have left just one or two remnants as isolated individuals on remote islands, in gorges, or in mountain forests; others have prospered and now exist as thousands of species. </p><p> <b>The classical arrangement</b> </p><p> Botanists are faced with the problem of showing in a list this complex result of millions of years of different lines of evolution. Linnaeus' system was based strictly on the sexual parts of the plant, the number of styles and stamens in each flower. This was convenient and worked quite well, but it was clearly artificial. Botanists soon began to work on more natural systems reflecting the evolutionary ancestry of plants, and ever since have continued the search for more natural groupings. The classical order of families was based on the premise that evolution of flowers was from the simple to the complex; thus magnolia and its relatives, with large, simple flowers, were considered especially primitive; daisies, on the other hand, with many flowers aggregated into a head that looks like a single flower, were considered advanced. </p><p> <b>New developments</b> </p><p> To classify modern plants accurately, we need to know their ancestry. Plant remains fossilize very poorly compared with bones or shells, but we can guess from fossils that trees in the coal-forming forests might have resembled giant clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, and conifers. Our knowledge of early flowering plants, probably appearing in the Jurassic, is even more scanty; it is likely many were aquatic herbs with no woody parts. Fortunately, we now have a new tool, DNA, to give clues to ancient relationships. DNA studies have confirmed the classical outline, but also show the true picture to be more complex. The relationships of several groups of plants that did not fit conveniently into any of the old schemes are now being clarified. Some of the major groupings and new evidence concerning their ordering are outlined on the following pages. Volume I follows broadly the order and relationships proposed by Kubitski and adapted by Mabberley in <i>The Plant Book</i> (1997); in Volume 2, I have been able to take into account more recently published DNA studies and have broadly followed the order proposed by Judd and co-workers in 1999. The monocotyledons are placed at the end in both volumes. </p><p> <b>Tree ferns, ginkgo, and conifers</b> </p><p> The ancient tropical swamp forests, which have ended up as coal today, were dominated by giant clubmosses, seed-ferns, and tree ferns, with primitive conifers. Few remnants of this flora have survived, probably because of the drastic changes in the world climate between the warm, wet Carboniferous and the dry Permian periods. Only some ancestors of <i>Osmunda</i> and relatives of the huge tropical fern <i>Marattia</i> survived from these warm forests; the modern ferns are a result of active evolution and divergence during the Triassic and Jurassic. Most of the tree ferns (see pp.16-17) are found in wet, cool tropical and subtropical forests, and the hardier ones come from the southern hemisphere. <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> (see p.18) is a remarkable survivor, the only one of its family. The leaves of this species and of many other, now extinct, <i>Ginkgo</i> species are found as far back as the Jurassic, and throughout the northern hemisphere in the early Tertiary. A second species, <i>G. adiantoides</i>, survived until the Miocene in North America, and into the Pliocene in Europe. <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> survived somewhere in China, where it was recognised as something special by early Chinese civilisation and widely planted in temple gardens. Other relicts such as the conifers <i>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</i> (see p.38) in China, and <i>Wollemia nobilis</i> in Australia also show how an ancient genus can survive in a small remote area. Conifers are today by far the most important group of ancient woody plants; they are thought to have originated as far back as the Devonian, but most of the present-day families can be traced back only as far as the Jurassic or Triassic. </p><p> <b>Magnolia, bay, and Calycanthus</b> </p><p> This group of families is interesting in having various combinations of primitive characteristics, that is, features that may have been present in the earliest flowering trees to grow on earth. Primitive wood anatomy, aromatic leaves, spirally arranged floral parts, and simple stamens with undifferentiated filaments are characteristics common in the group and thought to be primitive. In <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>Michelia</i>, and <i>Liriodendron</i> (the Magnoliaceae, see pp.56-59), the flowers are large and often showy, with numerous spirally arranged petals, stamens, and ovules. The related family Annonaceae (see p.65) is mainly tropical, and contains the custard apple, <i>Annona</i>, and the North American pawpaw, <i>Asimina triloba</i>. Winteraceae (see pp.60-61) which includes <i>Drimys</i>, is also primitive in many characteristics and probably belongs with the magnolia group. Also related to the Magnollaceae are the small but interesting families Illiclaceae (see p.63) and Schisandraceae (see p.62); <i>Schisandra</i>, with its unusual red, fleshy fruits in hanging chains, and <i>Kadsura</i>, with similar fruits in a round head, are the only genera in the latter. The bay tree family, the Lauraceae (see pp.66-71), contains over 2500 species, mainly in the tropical forests. Most species have small flowers but sometimes large fruit, for example the avocado tree <i>Persea americans</i>. Others are aromatic, including the bay itself, <i>Laurus</i>, and <i>Cinnamomum</i>, the cinnamon. Related to Lauraceae is the Calycanthaceae (see pp.72-73), containing both the chocolate-brown flowered Carolina and California allspice, <i>Calycanthus</i>, and the lovely white-flowered <i>Sinocalycanthus</i>, recently discovered in China. </p><p> <b>Witch hazel and Liquidambar</b> </p><p> The witch hazel family, Hamamelidaceae (see pp.99-109), and the related Cercidiphyllaceae (see p.96) are superficially similar in many characteristics to the catkin-bearing plants such as hazels (Betulaceae, see below and p.119). <i>Hamamelis</i> itself has clusters of strongly scented flowers with ribbon-shaped petals; in <i>Corylopsi</i></p></p><h2>Green Lantern: New Guardians Vol. 4: Gods and Monsters (The New 52)</h2><p>The Templar Guardians have been locked away for millennia, but they have a VERY clear idea of what they need to do next--and of all the Lanterns in the universe, they need a reluctant Kyle Rayner's help.

After we had overcome the initial shock, I tried to stop &nbsp;him speaking of her. I did not allow it unless to confirm alibis or to discuss covering up any possible evidence. It upset him too much and I thought it best to move on as if nothing had happened. Even though we did not talk about it, I couldn&#x2019;t help going over the events of the night in my mind, each time wishing that some aspect, some detail,<br> could be different, but facts are facts and we must get used to them.<br><br> It was the fourteenth of November 1980. It had all been arranged. Not her death, just the meeting to see if she was genuine, and if not, to get our money back. I walked the Strand for twenty minutes to ensure that there was nobody around, but I needn&#x2019;t have worried. The beach was deserted on that particularly bitter night. When I was satisfied that I was alone, I went to the bench and waited. A cruel wind rushed in with the waves and I pulled my cashmere coat around me and turned up the collar. Andrew arrived promptly and parked not far from where I was seated, as instructed. I watched from thirty yards away. I had told him to confront her. And I wanted to see her for myself, to assess her suitability. They were supposed to get out of the car and walk past me. But they didn&#x2019;t. After waiting ten minutes, I got up and walked toward the car, wondering what was taking so long. As I got closer, I could hear raised voices. And then I saw them fighting.<br><br> The passenger door swung open and she tried to get out. But he pulled her back toward him. I could see his hands around her throat. I watched her struggle, mesmerized momentarily, wondering if I could be imagining things, and then I came back to myself, snapped out of my confusion, and ran to the car.<br> &#x201c;Stop! Andrew! What are you doing?&#x201d; My voice was shrill to my own ears, and her eyes swiveled toward me in shock and terror before they rolled back upward into her head.<br> He released her immediately, and she fell backward, gurgling. She was almost but not quite dead, so I grabbed the steering-wheel lock from the footwell at her feet and smashed it down onto her skull, just once. There was blood and a little twitching and then absolute stillness.<br> I&#x2019;m not sure why I did that. Instinct?<br><br> She looked younger than her twenty-two years. I could see past the lurid makeup, the dyed-black hair, almost navy. There was a jagged white scar running from a deformed top lip to the septum of her nose. I wondered that Andrew had never thought to mention that. Her jacket had been pulled off one arm during the struggle, and I saw bloodied scabs in the crook of her elbow. There was a sarcastic expression on her face, a smirk that death could not erase. I like to think I did the girl a kindness, like putting an injured bird out of its misery. She did not deserve such kindness.<br><br> Andrew has always had a short fuse, blowing up at small, insignificant things and then, almost immediately, becoming remorseful and calm. This time, however, he was hysterical, crying and screaming fit to wake the dead.<br> &#x201c;Oh Christ! Oh Jesus!&#x201d; he kept saying, as if the son of God could fix anything. &#x201c;What have we done?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We?&#x201d; I was aghast. &#x201c;You killed her!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She laughed at me! You were right about her. She said I was an easy touch. That she&#x2019;d go to the press. She was going to blackmail me. I lost my temper. But you . . . you finished it, she might have been all right . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even . . . don&#x2019;t say that, you fool, you idiot!&#x201d;<br> His face was wretched, tormented. I felt sympathy for him. I told him to pull himself together. We needed to get home before Laurence did. I ordered him to help me get the body into the trunk. Through his tears, he carried out my instructions. Infuriatingly, his golf clubs were in there, unused for the last year, taking up most of the space, but luckily the corpse was as slight and slim as I had suspected, and still flexible, so we managed to stuff her in.<br> &#x201c;What are we going to do with her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. We have to calm down. We&#x2019;ll figure it out tomorrow. We need to go home now. What do you know about her? Does she have family? Who will be looking for her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. . . . She . . . I think she might have mentioned a sister?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right now nobody knows she is dead. Nobody knows she is missing. We need to keep it like that.&#x201d;<br><br> When we got home to Avalon at quarter past midnight, I could see by the shadow from his window that the bedside light was on in Laurence&#x2019;s bedroom. I had really wanted to be there when he got home, to hear how his evening had been. I told Andrew to pour us a brandy while I went to check on our son. He was sprawled across the bed and didn&#x2019;t stir when I ruffled his hair and kissed his forehead. &#x201c;Good night, Laurence,&#x201d; I whispered, but he was fast asleep. I turned out his lamp, closed his bedroom door, and went to the bathroom cabinet for a Valium before I went downstairs. I needed to be calm.<br> Andrew was trembling all over. &#x201c;Jesus, Lydia, we&#x2019;re in serious trouble. Maybe we should call the police.&#x201d;<br> I topped off his glass and drained the bottle into my own. He was in shock.<br> &#x201c;And ruin Laurence&#x2019;s life forever? Tomorrow is a new day. We&#x2019;ll deal with it then, but we must remember Laurence, whatever happens. He mustn&#x2019;t know anything.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Laurence? What has it to do with him? What about Annie? Oh God, we killed her, we murdered her. We&#x2019;re going to prison.&#x201d;<br> I was not going to prison. Who would look after Laurence? I stroked his arm in an effort to comfort him. &#x201c;We will figure it out tomorrow. Nobody saw us. Nobody can connect us with the girl. She would have been too ashamed to tell anyone what she was up to. We just have to figure out where to put her body.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure nobody saw us?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t a soul on the Strand. I walked the length of it to make sure. Go to bed, love. Things will be better tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> He looked at me as if I were insane.<br> I stared him down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one who strangled her.&#x201d;<br> Tears poured down his cheeks. &#x201c;But maybe if you hadn&#x2019;t hit her . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What? She would have died more slowly? Or been permanently brain damaged?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We could have said that we&#x2019;d found her like that!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Do you want to drive back there now and dump her, call an ambulance from a pay phone, and explain what you are doing there on the Strand at one o&#x2019;clock in the morning?&#x201d;<br> He looked into the bottom of his glass.<br> &#x201c;But what are we going to do?&#x201d; &#x201c;Go to bed.&#x201d;<br> As we ascended the stairs, I heard the whir of the washing machine. I wondered why Laurence had decided to do laundry on a Friday night. It was most unlike him. But it reminded me that my clothes and Andrew&#x2019;s really needed to be washed too. We both stripped, and I set aside the pile of laundry for the morning. I washed the sand off our shoes and swept the floors we had passed over. I deposited the sand from the dustpan in the back garden, on the raised patch of lawn beyond the kitchen window. I studied the ground for a moment. I had always thought of having a flower bed planted there.<br> When I slipped into bed later, I put my arms around Andrew&#x2019;s trembling form, and he turned to me and we made love, clawing at and clinging to each other like survivors of a terrible calamity.<br><br> Andrew had been a very good husband until just a year previously. For twenty-one years, our marriage had been solid. Daddy had been very impressed with him. On his deathbed, Daddy had said he was relieved to be leaving me in good hands. Andrew had been Daddy&#x2019;s apprentice at Hyland &amp; Goldblatt. He had taken Andrew under his wing and made him his protï¿½gï¿½. One day, when I was about twenty-five, Daddy had telephoned me at home and told me that we were having a special guest for dinner and that I should cook something nice and get my hair done. &#x201c;No lipstick,&#x201d; he said. Daddy had a thing about makeup. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand those painted trollops!&#x201d; he would say about American film stars. Daddy&#x2019;s views could be extreme. &#x201c;You are my beautiful daughter. No point in gilding a lily.&#x201d;<br> I was curious about this visitor and why I should dress up for him. I should have guessed, of course, that Daddy was intent on matchmaking. He needn&#x2019;t have worried. Andrew adored me right away. He went to enormous lengths to charm me. He said that he would do anything for me. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop looking at you,&#x201d; he said. And indeed, his eyes followed me everywhere. He always called me his prize, his precious jewel. I loved him too. My father always knew what was best for me.<br> Our courtship was short and very sweet. Andrew came from a good family. His late father had been a consultant pediatrician, and though I found his mother a little contrary, she raised no objections to our relationship. After all, when Andrew married me, he would get Avalon too&#x2014;a five-bedroom detached Georgian house on an acre of land in Cabinteely, South County Dublin. Andrew wanted us to get a house of our own when we got married, but Daddy put his foot down. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll move in here. This is Lydia&#x2019;s home. Don&#x2019;t look a gift horse in the mouth.&#x201d;<br> So Andrew moved in with us, and Daddy gave up the master bedroom and moved to the large bedroom on the other side of the hallway. Andrew grumbled a little to me. &#x201c;But, darling, don&#x2019;t you see how awkward it is? I&#x2019;m living with my boss!&#x201d; And I admit that Daddy did order Andrew around quite a lot, but Andrew got used to it quickly. I think he knew how lucky he was.<br> Andrew did not mind that I did not want to host parties or socialize with other couples. He said he was quite happy to keep me to himself. He was kind and generous and considerate. He usually backed away from confrontation, so we did not have many arguments. In a heated moment, he might kick or throw inanimate objects, but I think everyone does that from time to time. And he was always terribly contrite afterward.<br> Andrew worked his way up through the ranks until finally all his time on the golf course paid off, and three years ago, he was appointed as a judge in the criminal courts. He was a respected member of society. People listened to him when he spoke and quoted him in the newspapers. He was widely regarded as having the voice of reason on matters legal and judicial.<br> But last year, Paddy Carey, his old pal, accountant and golfing partner, had left the country with our money. I thought that, at the very least, Andrew would be careful with our finances. That was the husband&#x2019;s job, to be a provider and to look after the economic well-being of the household. But he had trusted Paddy Carey with everything and Paddy had fooled us all. We were left with nothing but debts and liabilities, and Andrew&#x2019;s generous salary barely covered our expenditure.<br> Had I married badly after all? My role was to be presentable, beautiful, charming&#x2014;a homemaker, a companion, a good cook, a lover, and a mother. A mother.<br> Andrew suggested selling some land to developers to raise capital. I was horrified at the suggestion. Nobody of our status would do such a thing. I had spent my whole life in Avalon. My father had inherited it from his father, and it was the house in which I was born. And the house in which my sister died. I was not going to compromise on selling any part of Avalon. Nor was I going to compromise on the money we needed to pay the girl.<br> But we had to take Laurence out of the hideously expensive Carmichael Abbey and send him to St. Martin&#x2019;s instead. It broke my heart. I knew he was unhappy there. I knew he was victimized because of his class and accent, but the money simply wasn&#x2019;t there. Andrew quietly sold some of the family silver to pay our debts, and we kept the wolf at bay. He could not risk being declared bankrupt, as he would have been forced to resign from the bench. We had never lived extravagantly, but the few luxuries that were normal to us began to disappear. He gave up his golf club membership but insisted that he could still pay my store account at Switzer&#x2019;s and Brown Thomas. He always hated to disappoint me.<br> But now this? A dead girl in the trunk of the car in the garage. I was sorry she was dead, but I can&#x2019;t honestly say I wouldn&#x2019;t or couldn&#x2019;t have strangled her myself under the circumstances. We just wanted our money back. I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about the scars on the girl&#x2019;s inner arm. I had seen a documentary about heroin addicts on the BBC, and reports of a heroin epidemic were in our newspapers. It seemed obvious that she had injected our money into her bloodstream, as if our needs and wants hadn&#x2019;t mattered.<br> As Andrew slept fitfully, whimpering and crying out occasionally, I made plans.<br><br> The next morning, a Saturday, Laurence slept late. I warned Andrew to say as little as possible. He readily agreed. He was hollow-eyed, and there was a tremor in his voice that never quite went away after that night. He and Laurence had always had a fraught relationship, so they were not inclined to be conversational. I planned to get Laurence out of the house for the day, send him into town on some errand or other while Andrew buried the girl in our garden. Andrew was shocked that we would bury her here, but I made him see that, this way, she could not be discovered. We were in control of our own property. Nobody had access without our permission. Our large rear garden was not overlooked. I knew exactly the spot where she could be buried. In my childhood there had been an ornamental pond under the plane tree beyond the kitchen window, but Daddy had filled it in after my sister&#x2019;s death. Its stone borders, which had lain under the soil for almost forty years, were conveniently grave-like.<br> After Andrew had buried the body, he could clean out and vacuum the car until there would be no trace of fibers or fingerprints. I was determined to take all precautions. Andrew knew from his job the kind of thing that could incriminate a person. Nobody had seen us on the Strand, but one can never be too sure of anything.<br><br> When Laurence arrived at the breakfast table, he had a noticeable limp. I tried to be cheerful. &#x201c;So how are you today, sweetie?&#x201d; Andrew stayed behind his Irish Times, but I could see his knuckles gripped it tightly to stop it from shaking.<br> &#x201c;My ankle hurts. I tripped going upstairs last night.&#x201d;<br> I examined his ankle quickly. It was very swollen and probably sprained. This thwarted my plans to send him into town. But I could still contain my boy, confine him to quarters, so to speak. I wrapped his ankle and instructed him to stay on the sofa all day. That way, I could keep an eye on him, keep him away from the rear of the house, where the burial was to take place. Laurence was not an active boy, so lying on the sofa watching television all day and having food delivered to him on a tray was no hardship to him at all.<br> As dusk fell, when everything had been done, Andrew lit a bonfire. I don&#x2019;t know what he was burning, but I had impressed upon him the need to get rid of all evidence. &#x201c;Think of it as one of your court cases&#x2014;what kinds of things betray the lie? Be thorough!&#x201d; To give him his due, he was thorough.<br> However, Laurence is a smart boy. He is intuitive, like me, and he noted his father&#x2019;s dark mood. Andrew was snappy about wanting to see the television news, terrified, I suppose, that the girl would feature. She did not. He claimed he had the flu a...</p><h2>Johnny Appleseed Goes a Planting (A Troll First-Start Tall Tale)</h2><p>Describes Johnny Appleseed&#39;s life on the road and his mission to plant trees</p><p></p><h2>There are men too gentle to live among wolves</h2><p>A modern classic with more than one million copies in print, There are Men Too Gentle to Live Among Wolves is an outstanding collection of poetry.

Beginning as an auctioneer and a dealer in cavalry and polo horses in the mid-1920s, he built an empire around a family of horses so singular in type and coloring that they came to be known simply as &#34;Wiescamp horses.&#34; Wiescamp&#39;s positive impact on all four of the major western horse registries - Quarter Horse, Appaloosa, Palomino, and Paint - is indisputable. He is the only man inducted into three breed association halls of fame: American Quarter Horse Association, Appaloosa Horse Club, and Palomino Horse Breeds of America.Here for the first time is Wiescamp&#39;s authorized biography - complete with the stories, the pedigrees, the show and race records, and the photographs that chronicle 70 years of horse breeding, showing, and selling activity.The Hank Wiescamp Story is the most comprehensive account ever written about one of the most storied horse breeders of all time. (Frank Holmes has been penning horse-related feature articles and historical books for more than 35 years. His interests have always been centered on the historical aspects of the western horse breeds, and his broad-based knowledge of the origins of the Quarter Horse, Paint, Appaloosa and Palomino registries have established him as one of the pre-eminent equine historians of all time. As a former staff writer for <i>Western Horseman</i> magazine, Frank co-authored volumes 2 through 5 of the immensely popular <i>Legends </i>book series.</p><h2>The Winning of the West, Volume 1: From the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, 1769-1776</h2><p>After political defeats and the loss of half his capital in a ranching venture in North Dakota, Theodore Roosevelt began writing his ambitious history of the conquest of the American West in 1888. He projected a sweeping drama, well documented and filled with Americans fighting Indian confederacies north and south while dealing with the machinations of the British, French, and Spanish and their sympathizers. Roosevelt wanted to show how backwoodsmen such as Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton, followed by hardy pioneer settlers, gave the United States eventual claim to land west of the Alleghanies. Heroism and treachery among both the whites and the Indians can be seen in his rapidly shifting story of a people on the move. By force and by treaty the new nation was established in the East, and when the explorers and settlers pushed against the Mississippi, everything west of the river was considered part of that nation.&nbsp;This volume describes the first settlers from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina moving out to the land between the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers. It proved to be a dark and bloody ground bordered by Indian tribes. Boone and the Long Hunters cut their way through the forests into Kentucky, John Sevier campaigned against the Cherokees, families huddled in wilderness forts.</p><p>This volume continues with the westward immigration via wilderness trails and keelboats on the Ohio. Roosevelt gives the whole unsettled picture after the Revolution, describing the separatist movement, the threat posed by the Spanish possessions, skirmishes with Indians incited by the British operating fur posts on the Great Lakes, the differences in the struggles for the Northwest and the Southwest and in their pioneering stock.The introduction is by John Milton Cooper Jr., a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the author of <i>The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt.</i></p><h2>The Works of John Clare</h2><p>John Clare is one of the foremost &#34;peasant poets&#34; of the English language.

Showing exceptional courage and extraordinary resilience, Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke, Samuel Baker, David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley risked their lives and their reputations in the name of this quest. They journeyed through East and Central Africa into unmapped territory, discovered the great lakes, Tanganyika and Victoria, navigated the upper Nile and the Congo, and suffered the ravages of flesh-eating ulcers, malaria and deep spear wounds. Using new research, Tim Jeal tells the story of these great expeditions, while also examining the tragic consequences which the Nile search has had on Uganda and Sudan to this day. &#34;Explorers of the Nile&#34; is a gripping adventure story with an arresting analysis of Britain&#39;s imperial past and the Scramble for Africa.</p><p>Praise for Tim Jeal&#x2019;s <i>Stanley</i>, winner of the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography<br><br>"A magnificent new life. . . .

The fun continues as Simon, along with his adoring young aide, Sir Giles, attends a crime writer's conference at Kinsale House presided over by its domineering chatelaine, Lady Hermione. To his astonishment, Simon discovers that the featured speaker purports to be one of his nom de plumes, Dorinda Darlington. The thoroughly nasty literary agent shared by all should be the murderer's object, but she has too much on her clients, and it's the Dorinda imposter who ends up squashed by a stone urn pushed from the terrace. The often flippant humor, overdone British slang and superior posturings of the book's self-absorbed detective may not be to every taste, but fully developed characters and a well-designed plot amply compensate.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flame Winds</h2><p>1st Berkley Publishing Corporation 1969 edition paperback vg+ book In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>It Started at Christmas...

And when she finds herself pregnant by a man wholly unsuitable for marriage or fatherhood, she doesn't hesitate a minute to have the baby on her own. Later, in present-day London, a young painter named Elina dizzily navigates the first weeks of motherhood. Her boyfriend, Ted, traumatized by nearly losing her in labor, begins to recover lost memories. At first he cannot place them, but as they emerge, we discover something heartbreaking and beautiful that connects these two stories. <br><br>A stunning portrait of motherhood and the artist's life in all their terror and glory, Maggie O'Farrell's newest novel is a gorgeous inquiry into the ways we make and unmake our lives, who we know ourselves to be, and how even our most accidental legacies connect us.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2010</strong>: Maggie O'Farrell has a singular knack for sensing the magnetic fields that push and pull people in love, and in <em>The Hand That First Held Mine</em>, she summons those invisible forces to tell two stories. The first is the spirited journey of Lexie Sinclair, a bright, tempestuous woman who finds her way from rural Devon to the center of postwar London's burgeoning art scene. Her force of personality makes her a natural critic (she's a wonderful tour guide to Soho's Bohemian circles), and she soon falls deeply in love. Fast forward fifty years and you'll meet Ted and Elina: a contemporary London couple who've just had their first child, both afflicted with a crisis of memory--Elina can recall only bits and pieces of her life before the baby, while Ted fights off memories he can't even recognize. O'Farrell alternates these plots artfully, always keeping the incorrigible Lexie in forward motion, while letting Ted and Elina wade further back in time. Inevitably, the two stories collide, and the result is a remarkably taut and unsentimental whole that embraces the unpredictable, both in love and in life. --<em>Anne Bartholomew<br><br></em> <br> <p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Maggie O'Farrell</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What made you want to write this book?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> A few years ago, I attended an exhibition of John Deakin's photographs at the National Portrait Gallery in London. Many of them were portraits of people in Soho in the 1950s: artists, writers, actors, musicians. Soho is an area of London that is famous for many things, but I hadn't known that, for a short time after the Second World War, it had been the center of an artistic movement. The bohemian, underground world that thrived there so briefly and was captured so vividly by Deakin fascinated me. I began to conceive a story about a girl, Lexie, who arrives there from a very conventional home and makes a life for herself as a journalist.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> There are two stories in the novel, aren't there?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The other story is set in the present and is about Elina, a young Finnish painter who has just had her first child. With Elina, I was interested in writing about new motherhood, those very first few weeks with a newborn--the shock and the rawness and the emotion and the exhaustion of it. It's something that's been done a great deal in nonfiction, but I haven't read much about it in fiction. Much of the novel is concerned with people whose lives change in an instant; a decision or a chance meeting or a journey occurs and suddenly your life veers off on a new course. Having your first child is one of those times. As soon as the newborn takes its first breath, life as you've known it is gone and a new existence begins.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you decide to divide the novel into two time frames?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I liked the idea of these two women living in the same city, fifty years apart. Lexie and Elina have no inkling of each other's existence, but they hear each other's echoes through time. And, as it turns out, they are linked in other ways--in ways neither of them could ever have expected.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> As well as motherhood and the unexpectedness of life, there's a great deal about love in the book as well, isn&#x2019;t there?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Love in many forms powers the book: familial, platonic, and also romantic. Lexie has many different men in her life. There's Felix, the feckless yet famous TV news reporter, and Robert, the rather more serious biographer. But the great love of her life is Innes Kent, the man she follows to London, who takes her under his wing and gives her her first job as a journalist.</p> <p>Elina's relationship with her boyfriend Ted is challenged by the arrival of their baby. Ted begins to recall things from his own infancy, and these things don&#x2019;t seem to fit. I was interested in the way having children makes you remember and reassess your own childhood, in micro-detail: things I'd never thought about or remembered before would suddenly rear their head. And this made me wonder what it would be like if the memories that resurfaced were of places and people you didn't recognize, if your own life suddenly seemed strange to you.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did you have to do a lot of research for the book?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The 1950s and 1960s are not that distant in time, and the sixties in particular are very well documented in art, film, photography, and literature. I read history books but also made sure to submerge myself in novels of the period. You get wonderful insights into the way people spoke then; it was quite different from the way English is spoken in London now. The cadences and vocabulary have completely changed. So I read Iris Murdoch, Muriel Spark, Jean Rhys, Margaret Drabble, Margaret Forster. Novels also give you tiny details you didn't even know you needed--how a telephone worked in a house of bed-sitters, for example. Where one bought peacock-blue stockings in 1957.</p> <p>You have to be careful with research, though. There's a terrible temptation, once you've done all this collecting of interesting details, to shoehorn in as much of it as you can. You can sometimes find yourself writing a sentence along the lines of "She picked up the telephone, which was made of Bakelite, a substance first developed in 1907 by a Belgian chemist..." At which point you have to stop and try to forget everything you know about early plastic manufacture. Most research you have to throw out. But you still need to do it, to give yourself confidence and scaffolding.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> London as a city has a strong presence in the book. Was this deliberate?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I felt all the way through as if London were the third main character in the novel, along with Lexie and Elina. Most of the novel was written while I was living away from London, so I suppose I was re-creating a city with which I have had a very long relationship (a rather off-and-on one, to be honest).</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> To what degree does your own life play into your fiction?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I don't write autobiographically. Fiction for me is an escape, an alternative existence, so I wouldn't want to re-create my life on the page. There are elements of my life that filter into my books, but they are usually recast and redrawn and reimagined to such a degree as to be unrecognizable to me or anyone else. Lexie and Elina both arrive in London as adults, as I did, and Lexie becomes a journalist, as I did. The scenes about motherhood I couldn't, of course, have written without having been a mother myself. The rest is made up.<br></p> <p><strong>Recommended Reading from Maggie O'Farrell</strong></p> <p><em>The Girls of Slender Means</em> by Muriel Spark: My favorite Spark, I think.

What is it like to walk through an alien world? Artists have been imagining otherworldly landscapes for hundreds of years&#x2014;but only in the past few decades have we started to see what other planets and moons really look like. These exciting scientific discoveries have led to ever more "realistic" space art. <i>Space Art</i> shows artists how to capture and create these partly real, partly imagined vistas by combining the latest facts with traditional landscape drawing. Put the two together and the results are memorable, dreamlike, haunting. Author Michael Carroll, one of the country's most distinguished astronomical artists, explains how to use washes and texturing, how to paint water and ice, rocks and geological formations, craters and alien skies. Linear and atmospheric perspective, color, composition, color, value, and shading are also covered as they relate to showing otherworldly landscapes. Fourteen paintings, building in complexity, are presented step-by-step, accompanied by NASA photos and the author&#x2019;s own photos of mysterious landscapes closer to home: Death Valley, Iceland, Alaska. For everyone who has ever wanted to travel to far-off worlds... or just show what they&#x2019;re imagining... <i>Space Art</i> is a rocket to the stars.</p><p><b>Michael Carroll</b>, a renowned astronomical and paleo artist for more than twenty years, has done work for NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His art has appeared in many magazines, including <i>Time, National Geographic, Sky &amp; Telescope</i>, and <i>Asimov&#x2019;s Science Fiction</i>. One of his paintings flew aboard MIR; another is resting at the bottom of the Atlantic, aboard Russia's ill-fated Mars 96 spacecraft.

A small clearing, out of the way, up among a scatter of great lichened boulders, under the shadow of firs and at the foot of a big red cedar; a place where no casual passerby would go, but not inaccessible. He meant to bring them up here&#x2014;the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fergus, to begin with. Maybe just Fergus, by himself. Mam had raised Fergus from the time he was ten, and he&#x2019;d had no mother before that. Fergus had known Mam longer than Ian had, and loved her as much. <i>Maybe more,</i> he thought, his grief aggravated by guilt. Fergus had stayed with her at Lallyï¿½broch, helped to take care of her and the place; he hadn&#x2019;t. He swallowed hard and, walking into the small clear space, set his stone in the middle, then stood back to look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even as he did so, he found himself shaking his head. No, it had to be two cairns. His mam and Uncle Jamie were brother and sister, and the family could mourn them here together&#x2014;but there were others he might bring, maybe, to remember and pay their respects. And those were the folk who would have known Jamie Fraser and loved him well but wouldn&#x2019;t ken Jenny Murray from a hole in the&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The image of his mother <i>in</i> a hole in the ground stabbed him like a fork, retreated with the recollection that she wasn&#x2019;t after all in a grave, and stabbed again all the harder for that. He really couldn&#x2019;t bear the vision of them drowning, maybe clinging to each other, struggling to keep&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;A Dhia!&#x201d;</i> he said violently, and dropped the stone, turning back at once to find more. He&#x2019;d seen people drown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tears ran down his face with the sweat of the summer day; he didn&#x2019;t mind it, only stopping now and then to wipe his nose on his sleeve. He&#x2019;d tied a rolled kerchief round his head to keep the hair and the stinging sweat out of his eyes; it was sopping before he&#x2019;d added more than twenty stones to each of the cairns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He and his brothers had built a fine cairn for their father before he died, at the head of the carved stone that bore his name&#x2014;all his names, in spite of the expense&#x2014;in the burying ground at Lallybroch. And then later, at the funeral, members of the family, followed by the tenants and then the servants, had come one by one to add a stone each to the weight of remembrance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fergus, then. Or&nbsp;. . . no, what was he thinking? Auntie Claire must be the first he brought here. She wasn&#x2019;t Scots herself, but she kent fine what a cairn was and would maybe be comforted a bit to see Uncle Jamie&#x2019;s. Aye, right. Auntie Claire, then Fergus. Uncle Jamie was Fergus&#x2019;s foster father; he had a right. And then maybe Marsali and the children. But maybe Germain was old enough to come with Fergus? He was ten, near enough to being a man to understand, to be treated like a man. And Uncle Jamie was his grandsire; it was proper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stepped back again and wiped his face, breathing heavily. Bugs whined and buzzed past his ears and hovered over him, wanting his blood, but he&#x2019;d stripped to a loincloth and rubbed himself with bear grease and mint in the Mohawk way; they didn&#x2019;t touch him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Look over them, O spirit of red cedar,&#x201d; he said softly in Mohawk, gazing up into the fragrant branches of the tree. &#x201c;Guard their souls and keep their presence here, fresh as thy branches.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He crossed himself and bent to dig about in the soft leaf mold. A few more rocks, he thought. In case they might be scattered by some passing animal. Scattered like his thoughts, which roamed restless to and fro among the faces of his family, the folk of the Ridge&#x2014;God, might he ever go back there? Brianna. Oh, Jesus, Brianna&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He bit his lip and tasted salt, licked it away and moved on, foraging. She was safe with Roger Mac and the weans. But, Jesus, he could have used her advice&#x2014;even more, Roger Mac&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who was left for him to ask, if he needed help in taking care of them all?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thought of Rachel came to him, and the tightness in his chest eased a little. Aye, if he had Rachel&nbsp;. . . She was younger than him, nay more than nineteen, and, being a Quaker, had very strange notions of how things should be, but if he had her, he&#x2019;d have solid rock under his feet. He hoped he <i>would</i> have her, but there were still things he must say to her, and the thought of that conversation made the tightness in his chest come back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The picture of his cousin Brianna came back, too, and lingered in his mind: tall, long-nosed and strong-boned as her father&nbsp;. . . and with it rose the image of his <i>other</i> cousin, Bree&#x2019;s half brother. Holy God, William. And what ought he to do about William? He doubted the man kent the truth, kent that he was Jamie Fraser&#x2019;s son&#x2014;was it Ian&#x2019;s responsibility to tell him so? To bring him here and explain what he&#x2019;d lost?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He must have groaned at the thought, for his dog, Rollo, lifted his massive head and looked at him in concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I dinna ken that, either,&#x201d; Ian told him. &#x201c;Let it bide, aye?&#x201d; Rollo laid his head back on his paws, shivered his shaggy hide against the flies, and relaxed in boneless peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ian worked awhile longer and let the thoughts drain away with his sweat and his tears. He finally stopped when the sinking sun touched the tops of his cairns, feeling tired but more at peace. The cairns rose knee-high, side by side, small but solid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stood still for a bit, not thinking anymore, just listening to the fussing of wee birds in the grass and the breathing of the wind among the trees. Then he sighed deeply, squatted, and touched one of the cairns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Tha gaol agam oirbh, a Mhï¿½thair,&#x201d;</i> he said softly. <i>My love is upon you, Mother.</i> Closed his eyes and laid a scuffed hand on the other heap of stones. The dirt ground into his skin made his fingers feel strange, as though he could maybe reach straight through the earth and touch what he needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stayed still, breathing, then opened his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Help me wi&#x2019; this, Uncle Jamie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I dinna think I can manage, alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dirty Bastard</b></p><p></p><p>W</p><p>illiam Ransom, Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, Viscount Ashness, Baron Derwent, shoved his way through the crowds on Market Street, oblivious to the complaints of those rebounding from his impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know where he was going, or what he might do when he got there.

He swung round to see a young woman looking at him with some interest.

Her gaze reached his silver-buckled shoes and returned to his face with more interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; he said, hoarse and bitter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, really?&#x201d; She left the shelter of the doorway in which she&#x2019;d been lingering and came across the alley to stand right in front of him. She was tall and slim and had a very fine pair of high young breasts&#x2014;which were clearly visible under the thin muslin of her shift, because, while she had a silk petticoat, she wore no stays. No cap, either&#x2014;her hair fell loose over her shoulders. A whore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m partial to bastards myself,&#x201d; she said, and touched him lightly on the arm. &#x201c;What kind of bastard are you? A wicked one?

Of all the unlikely sources of succor I could have imagined&nbsp;. . .

No need for apologies or spoken forgiveness. She&#x2019;d never had to wear the mask that Jamie did. What she thought and felt was there in her eyes, those slanted blue cat eyes she shared with her brother. She knew the truth now of what I was, and she knew I loved&#x2014;and always had loved&#x2014;her brother with all my heart and soul&#x2014;despite the minor complications of my being presently married to someone else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She heaved a sigh, eyes closing for an instant, then opened them and smiled at me, mouth trembling only a little.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, fine and dandy,&#x201d; said Mrs.&nbsp;Figg shortly. She narrowed her eyes and rotated smoothly on her axis, taking in the panorama of destruction. The railing at the top of the stair had been ripped off, and cracked banisters, dented walls, and bloody smudges marked the path of William&#x2019;s descent. Shattered crystals from the chandelier littered the floor, glinting festively in the light that poured through the open front door, the door itself cracked through and hanging drunkenly from one hinge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Merde</i> on toast,&#x201d; Mrs.&nbsp;Figg murmured.

Almost a full bottle&#x2014;terrible waste of good liquor, that would be.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My insides turned over promptly. Turtle soup&#x2014;with a lot of sherry&#x2014;had certain strong and private associations for me, these being connected with Jamie, feverish delirium, and the way in which a heaving ship assists sexual intercourse. Contemplation of which would <i>not</i> assist the impending discussion in the slightest. I rubbed a finger between my brows, in hopes of dispelling the buzzing cloud of confusion gathering there. The air in the house still felt electric.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Walt and Skeezix, Book 2</h2><p><p><b>"<i>Gasoline Alley</i> clearly belongs in the cannon as a deeply American masterwork of cartooning." -Time.com</b></p><p><i>Walt and Skeezix: Book Two </i>collects the <i>Gasoline Alley </i>strips by the great American cartoonist Frank King from 1923 to 1924. King was the first cartoonist to have his characters age in real time and have modern story lines, a landmark conception for comic strips in the early twentieth century. There is a new eighty-page introduction by journalist Jeet Heer.</p></p><p><p>Cartoonist/designer <b>Chris Ware </b>is the author of <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest</i><br><i>Kid on Earth</i>, <i>Quimby the Mous</i>e, and the <i>Acme Novelty Datebook </i>(D+Q, 2003).Ware was born in 1967, two years before Frank King's death.</p>In the second volume collecting King's entire run <i>Gasoline Alley</i>, the focus shifts from the strip's original range of colorful characters to bachelor Walt Wallet and Skeezix, the foundling whose arrival on Walt's doorstep changed the strip from a comedy about the emerging automobile culture to the warmhearted, domestic "dramedy" that continues to this day. In the first indication of the more-or-less real-time progression that became the strip's hallmark, Skeezix becomes a toddler in these episodes. Although King's drawing style is gaining in mastery to handle the strip's growing seriousness, the major progress here is in the story, as King injects drama and suspense into long continuities devoted to the growing relationship between Walt and his neighbor Mrs. Blossom, the adoption hearing for Skeezix, the nationwide hunt in the wake of Skeezix's kidnapping by his mysterious birth mother, and a cross-country auto race between Walt and fellow car buff Avery--the first of the extended travel sequences that King undertook during his four-decade tenure and that allowed his visual brilliance to shine. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

And a question began to take shape: How does the United States, peopled by every race on earth, remain united? Caputo resolved that one day he'd drive from the nation's southernmost point to the northernmost point reachable by road, talking to everyday Americans about their lives and asking how they would answer his question.</p><p>So it was that in 2011, in an America more divided than in living memory, Caputo, his wife, and their two English setters made their way in a truck and classic trailer (hereafter known as "Fred" and "Ethel") from Key West, Florida, to Deadhorse, Alaska, covering 16,000 miles. He spoke to everyone from a West Virginia couple saving souls to a Native American shaman and taco entrepreneur. What he found is a story that will entertain and inspire readers as much as it informs them about the state of today's United States, the glue that holds us all together, and the conflicts that could cause us to pull apart.</p></p><p><p><b>Philip Caputo</b> is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of many works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>A Rumor of War</i>, one of the most highly praised books of the twentieth century. His novels include <i>Acts of Faith</i>, <i>The Voyage</i>, <i>Horn of Africa</i>, and his most recent, <i>Crossers</i>. He and his wife, Leslie Ware, divide their time between Norwalk, Connecticut, and Patagonia, Arizona.</p><p>1.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t know why my dream fell into such a long slumber. However, after careful investigation, I can identify what woke it up.</p> <p>At the root was a condition I&#x2019;ve suffered from for most of my life. I trace its origins to my childhood in the forties and fifties, when my father, a traveling machinist for the Continental Can Company, maintained and repaired the machines leased to canning factories in central and northern Wisconsin. He would leave our home in suburban Chicago in the late spring, and when school let out for the summer he returned to fetch my mother, my sister, and me to spend the next three months with him.</p> <p>After the suitcases were stowed in the trunk of the company car, always a no-frills Chevrolet, we would head north on U.S. 45 or U.S. 41, then two-lane blacktops. Some kids would have been sad to leave their friends for the summer, but that moment when we swung onto the highway never failed to fill me with a tingling anticipation. We lived in different places over the years&#x2014;backwoods cabins without indoor plumbing, lakeside cottages, houses in towns with Indian names like Shawano, or French names like Fond du Lac, or plain-vanilla American names like Green Lake&#x2014;but the destination never excited me as much as the getting there. I loved to feel the wind slapping me through the open windows, and to inhale the strong smells of manure and silage as the Chevy rolled past corn and pea and beet fields speckled with the straw hats of the migrant workers who brought a touch of the exotic to the midwestern countryside&#x2014;Mexican braceros, tall Jamaicans. I loved watching farmhouses whiz by, barns decorated with faded advertisements for feed companies and chewing tobacco, and the landscape change from field and pasture to somber pine forests jeweled with lakes.</p> <p>Long ago, when I was a correspondent in the Middle East, I spent a couple of weeks wandering the Sinai Desert with bedouin tribesmen and an Israeli anthropologist familiar with their culture. He told me that their migrations were not always dictated by the need to find water or better grazing for their herds; sometimes they struck their tents and began to move for no discernible reason. He was forced to conclude that they were animated by an impulse, perhaps lodged in their nomadic genes, to get going, it didn&#x2019;t matter where.</p> <p>I knew the feeling.</p> <p><br>My father died on March 2, 2010, at age ninety-four. My wife, Leslie Ware, and I were at our house in Patagonia, a small southern Arizona town where we spend part of each winter, when my sister, Pat, phoned with the news from Scottsdale. My father had gone to live there with her and my brother-in-law after my mother&#x2019;s death in 2001. His passing, my sister said, had been quick, painless, even serene, so I felt more grateful than mournful as Leslie and I drove to Scottsdale for the memorial service. It was held at a spanking-new, faux-adobe mortuary that could have been mistaken, from the outside, for an upscale desert spa. Before the service began, I spent a few minutes alone with my father in a back room. He hadn&#x2019;t been dressed yet, and he lay on a steel gurney, a sheet covering him to the neck to hide his nakedness and the embalmer&#x2019;s incisions. His hair had been combed, a pleasant expression put on his face, makeup applied to restore his complexion to its former ruddiness. The cosmetics were so artful and he&#x2019;d been around so long that I had a hard time believing he was really, truly gone. It became easier when I laid a hand on his forehead, cold as a rock in winter.</p> <p>I spoke to him nonetheless, on the off chance that he could hear me, telling him that I would always remember him, that I would miss him, that although we&#x2019;d had some sharp differences I&#x2019;d never stopped loving him. Then I reminisced about the trip we&#x2019;d made to Wisconsin a year after my mother&#x2019;s death. We&#x2019;d gone to Shawano Lake to look for the beach where I&#x2019;d taken my first steps in 1942. He wanted to see it again. Our only guide was an old photograph showing my mother holding my hand as I toddled uncertainly in the sand. There in the mortuary I reminded him of how amazed we&#x2019;d been to find that beach, hardly changed in sixty years. As we stood on it, he&#x2019;d grown nostalgic and talked about his early days on the road, traveling from cannery to cannery with his oak toolbox, its felt-lined drawers crammed with the precision instruments of his trade. &#x201c;There was nothing like it,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, wistfully. &#x201c;To be in a car with everything you need, nothing more, and an open road in front of you.&#x201d;</p> <p>No two people could have been less alike than my father and Jack Kerouac, yet there had been the same spirit in the words he&#x2019;d spoken as in those Kerouac had written: &#x201c;Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road.&#x201d;</p> <p>My father&#x2019;s death plunged me into melancholy reflections on old age and the brevity of life, even one as long as his. In a less-than-celebratory mood, I marked my sixty-ninth birthday later that spring, after Leslie and I were back at our home in Connecticut, where we live most of the year. The milestone of seventy was coming up fast. In this era of longer life spans, you can kid yourself at sixty that you have plenty of time left, but <i>seventy</i> has the unmistakable ring of mortality. You quit cigarettes and hard partying years ago, you eat healthy servings of fruits and vegetables, you take your Lipitor faithfully, you exercise, and still you wake up at the hour of the night when it&#x2019;s impossible to entertain illusions, and you can almost see him at the foot of your bed, black wings spread as if about to enfold you.</p> <p><i>Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me</i> . . . Well, a lot of my life was behind me . . . and ahead?</p> <p>As if struck by an electrical charge, the sleeping cicada born on Barter Island cracked its shell, rose in flight, and began to buzz insistently in my ear. By road from the subtropics to the Arctic.</p> <p>I went to my laptop, looked up directions from Key West, Florida, to Deadhorse, Alaska. A map of North America flashed on the screen. A blue, diagonal line zigzagged across it, marking the most direct route from the southernmost to the northernmost point&#x2014;5,475 miles, according to the driving directions. And that was one way, not to mention that I would have to drive from Connecticut to Key West&#x2014;1,486 miles&#x2014;just to get to the starting point. Then, of course, I would have to return to Connecticut from Deadhorse&#x2014;4,780 miles. The total distance&#x2014;11,741 miles&#x2014;gave me sticker shock. Round it up to twelve thousand. Almost halfway around the world! It seemed slightly mad, but then it might do me good. To make such an epic road trip, discovering places I&#x2019;d never been, rediscovering others, never knowing what I&#x2019;d find beyond the next curve or hill, would be to recapture the enchantment of youth, a sense of promise and possibility.</p> <p>The cicada chirped incessantly in my head. I clicked back to the first map. Looking at it brought on a mixture of eagerness and reluctance. The buzzing grew more shrill. <i>If you don&#x2019;t go now, geezer, you never will</i>. I listened to my inner cicada, and the uneasiness subsided. If I&#x2019;d learned anything, it was that the things you do never cause as much regret as the things you don&#x2019;t.</p> <p>But I didn&#x2019;t decide to go purely for the adventure. Fourteen years earlier, standing in front of the Harold Kaveolook School, I&#x2019;d asked, What held the nation together? What made the <i>pluribus unum</i>?</p> <p>Now I revised that question&#x2014;would it continue to hold together?&#x2014;because the America of 2010 wasn&#x2019;t the America of 1996. I&#x2019;d been living in it the whole time but in some ways did not recognize it.</p> <p>The worst economic calamity since the Great Depression. Foreclosures, bankruptcies, millions of homes under water, and millions of people out of work. The wages of the employed stagnant, except for CEOs, investment bankers, and the practitioners of casino capitalism on Wall Street, all of whom were making more money than ever. People were angry. In Texas, crowds at a political event had called on their governor to secede from the union. In Nevada, a candidate for a U.S. Senate seat had suggested that if conservatives like herself didn&#x2019;t get their way they might resort to armed insurrection. Strangely enough, much of this fury wasn&#x2019;t directed at the financial mandarins who had brought the nation to the edge of the abyss; no, it fell on citizens like the aging engineer who, afflicted with Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, was mocked and abused at a Tea Party rally in Ohio because he supported health-care reform. That was the America I didn&#x2019;t recognize&#x2014;spiteful and cruel.</p> <p>In geology, a rift is a long, narrow zone where stresses in the earth&#x2019;s crust are causing it to rupture. In North America, one such formation is the Rio Grande Rift, which is pulling apart at the rate of two millimeters a year. You might say, with considerable license, that it&#x2019;s very slowly tearing the continent in half. I couldn&#x2019;t help but see it as a metaphor for the stresses that seemed to be ripping our political and social fabric. But was the country really as fractured as it appeared in the media? As bitter and venomous? It wasn&#x2019;t my intention to take the pulse of the nation; the United States is too big, too complicated a mosaic of races and nationalities and walks of life to have a single pulse or even two or three. But I thought I&#x2019;d ask people, when possible, the question I&#x2019;d put to myself: what holds us together?</p> <p><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2013 by Philip Caputo<br></p></p><h2>Where the Whaups Are Crying: A Dumfires and Galloway Anthology</h2><p>This anthology of Scottish writers and writing includes work by John Buchan, Walter Scott, Thomas Carlyle, James Boswell, Daniel Defoe, John Welsley, J.M.

The book focuses on the first day of the Allied invasion of southern France, and on the airborne and commando troops who spearheaded the attack. Breuer integrates the stories of veterans of these forces into a fast-paced narrative that reestablishes war as the province of confusion, particularly in the context of a nighttime air assault. The victory that emerged from the chaos of Dragoon's first hours owed less to planning than to the fighting spirit and fighting power of these men. The book complements Alan Wilt's The French Riviera Campaign (Southern Illinois Univ. Pr., 1981) and compares with S.L.A. Marshall's Night Drop (Battery, 1982. reprint).

From ship&#39;s chronometers to digital clocks, from time-balls to time pips, from dreamtime to flexitime, clocks and time-keeping have been the quiet revolutionaries of Australian history. As the convict era drew to an end, the colonial governors looked to clocks as the mechanical policemen of an emerging free society. Fifty years later, as railways and telegraphs began to spread across the land, and pocket watches appeared on the waistcoats of working men, colonial society began to keep stricter hours of work and play, and to teach its children the virtue of punctuality. In the early 20th century, punch clocks and time-switches laid the basis for new patterns of work in the factory and the home. Now, in the 1990s, the &#34;faceless clocks&#34; in computers and automated control systems have created a &#34;postmodern&#34; time regime that is both more flexible, and more demanding, than its predecessors. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical insights and primary sources, &#34;The Unforgiving Minute&#34; offers an original interpretation of Australian history.</p><p></p><h2>V: The Second Generation</h2><p>In 1984 Kenneth Johnson stunned the television world with his enormously popular miniseries of alien invasion, V. The V novelisation was a bestseller. Now, to the delight of millions of fans and a new generation who have yet to discover the power of V, Johnson has written the exciting conclusion of his epic thriller. Suffering under the lash of the alien Visitors&#39; control, the human underground have risked their lives for decades as they desperately try to find ways to thwart their reptilian overlords&#39; dire plan. For while the Visitors claim to be Earth&#39;s friends, they instead seek only to exploit our planet&#39;s lifeblood-water-and slaughter all humankind.But now the Underground has hope, because our call for help, sent out to the stars long ago, has been answered by agents of another alien race. They have come to Earth, to aid the Underground in defeating the Visitors.

According to Professor Noble, it is &#34;much more than human and political geography,&#34; encompassing myriad forms of political and institutional structures - from monarchies to participatory republics - and its own traditions of political discourse. It involves choices about who gets to participate in any given society and the ways in which societies have resolved the tension between individual self-interest and the common good. Within this series of 48 lectures, you&#39;ll discover the many ways in which Western civilization has addressed those questions, from its first stirrings in the great river valleys of Iraq and Egypt in 3000 B.C to the beginning of the 17th century and the dawn of the modern world. Your learning will cover vast amounts of territory and thousands of years, beginning in the ancient Near East and moving to Greece and then Rome. You&#39;ll explore ancient empires, including those of Persia, Alexander the Great, and Rome. You&#39;ll watch as western Europe gradually expands, both physically and culturally. And you&#39;ll examine the globalizations of Western civilization with the Portuguese and Spanish voyages of exploration and discovery. This broad and panoramic series, ripe with the telling detail on which history can turn, will help you pull an enormous sweep of history together into one coherent - though by no means closed - framework as you watch history develop under the influence of such critical factors as ecology and environment, geography, and climate; government and economics; technology; religion; work and leisure; philosophy; literature; art and architecture; and virtues, values, and aesthetics.</p><p></p><h2>Turning the Tide: Real Hope, Real Change</h2><p><b>Now in paperback&#x2014;<i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Charles Stanley shares a thought-provoking, inspirational book calling our nation to get on its knees to pray, then stand up and become involved.</b><br><br><b><i>Get on Your Knees to Pray... </i></b><b><i>Then Get Up and Take ACTION </i></b><br><br>There is a tidal wave threatening our nation, and its unrelenting surge is changing American life as we&#x2019;ve known it . . . and as our Founding Fathers intended it to be.

Insisting we <i>can </i>make a difference, Dr. Stanley makes a passionate plea for Christians to get on their knees to pray, and then stand up and become involved. With wisdom and biblical teaching, he insists that if we will turn to God and obey Him, we can: <br><br>* <i>Reverse the course of our financial troubles </i><br><br>* <i>Stop the onslaught of increasingly burdensome taxation </i><br><br>* <i>Halt the advancement of socialism in public policy </i><br><br>* <i>Return respect for the sanctity of life to the national discourse </i><br><br>In this revolutionary book, bestselling author Dr. Charles Stanley also offers a <i>step-by-step twenty-week prayer guide </i>to help Christians pray for real change. It&#x2019;s time, Dr. Stanley says, for us to take responsibility for the direction of our country and become involved both at the civic level and through fervent prayer.</p><p>Dr. Charles F.

Not long ago, I was at a Hawaiian seashore known for its tremendous waves&#x2014;ones worthy of surfing excursions&#x2014;and I was acutely aware of the rise and fall of the tides.<br> <br>On several occasions in the past, this particular coastline has had waves that rose more than twenty feet high. A man at the hotel called those times &#x201c;an extreme surfer&#x2019;s paradise.&#x201d;<br> <br>While the unfurling and crashing of breakers of that magnitude may excite avid surfers, the rest of us, however, are frightened by such an overpowering crush of water&#x2014;fantastic to look at, perhaps, but only from a distance.<br> <br>As I gazed out at the ocean, knowing the potential danger for great waves, my thoughts turned to the painful reality of the tsunami that crashed into Japan in 2011. The devastation in terms of lives and property loss was enormous.<br> <br>I then began to think about the riptides that can periodically make a beach too dangerous for swimming. Although these tides can be identified by lifeguards and experts as they watch from elevated perches, they are not as easily recognized by beachgoers on the shore or those already in the water. Once an innocent swimmer has been caught in the clutches of such a powerful current, escape is extremely difficult. Rescue is often perilous for those who seek to help. Death is frequently the result.<br> <br>I considered the rising floodwaters that have devastated many areas in our nation. We live in an age where it is not at all unusual to hear a newscaster report, &#x201c;Nothing of this magnitude has ever been experienced here before.&#x201d;<br> <br>I asked myself, <i>What makes tides go from beautiful to dangerous? What causes the sea to swell and produce a wave that washes away beaches and cities? What creates those waves?</i><br> <br>The answer in many cases is <i>storms.</i><br> <br>Some of the squalls pound on the surface of the waters, while others occur far away, causing a ripple effect throughout the ocean.<br> <br>Some tempests involve fierce winds; and others, a seemingly endless amount of heavy rain.<br> <br>Regardless of how these whirlwinds and downpours occur or where they originate, they cause seismic shifts in the waters&#x2014;and the tides rise with immensely destructive power.<br> <br>These observations of nature started me thinking about the issues I will discuss in this book&#x2014;tempests that occur in our nation and also in our personal lives. These storms don&#x2019;t necessarily have anything to do with weather. They are situations in our lives that devastate us just like a category-five hurricane that ravages a coastal village. They may arise due to our finances, a broken relationship, a lost job, a crippling illness, or any number of distressing circumstances. The dark, threatening clouds roll in&#x2014;large, turbulent, and overwhelming. They destroy our peace and security, and we cannot escape their fury. We don&#x2019;t know what to do or where to go.<br> <br>I am convinced that our country is facing just such a storm. We are experiencing a destructive, man-made tide that is deteriorating our country at a frightening pace. And as an American citizen, father, grandfather, and preacher of the Word, I feel the responsibility to speak up about the issues in our country and in our personal lives that require our attention and intercession as believers.<br> <br> <b> <b>RISING TIDES ON MANY FRONTS</b> <br> </b> <br> <br>The storms of life cause tides to mount&#x2014;even to the point of overwhelming us with tragedy, turmoil, and deeply rooted fears.<br> <br>We experience catastrophic times, not just natural, everyday problems but also man-made disasters. Sadly, if we don&#x2019;t come to grip with our crises and learn how to manage effectively through them, we will continue to find ourselves in increasingly desperate times.<br> Note <br> <b>As An American citizen, father, grandfather, and preacher of the word, I feel the responsibility to speak up about the issues in our country and in our personal lives that require our attention and intercession as believers.</b> <br> <br>Just as our personal tempests can devastate our lives if we do not respond to them appropriately, cataclysmic storms can drastically affect our nation as well. So, after my experience on that Hawaiian beach, I sat down to make a list of the storms our country is currently undergoing. I came up with twenty concerns that I truly believe warrant prayer and godly action.<br> <br>Not all of the items on my list are equal in weight, nor are they presented here in order of priority. However, I believe they are all important in terms of our nation&#x2019;s health and spiritual welfare. If we fail to properly address these storms, they will eventually become an insurmountable tide that will erode our freedoms as citizens of the United States of America.<br> <br>Below are the issues and conditions I believe are impacting our country negatively:<br> <br>1. <i>Mortgage problems:</i> many people are unable to pay their mortgages and are losing their homes. This not only affects the families that become homeless but also impacts their neighborhoods, communities, and all of us as a nation.<br> <br>2. <i>Increasing unemployment:</i> Millions of people have lost their jobs and even more families suffer because they cannot pay their bills or afford their necessities.<br> <br>3. <i>Banking issues:</i> Our nation is facing an overwhelming financial crisis, which includes the insolvency of many banks, tremendous losses for depositors and investors, escalating costs, an excessive national debt, and the weakening of our currency on the international market.<br> <br>4. <i>Corrupt leaders:</i> Our nation is plagued with cowardice, confusion, and corruption in its leadership&#x2014;on both sides of the aisle. We are in desperate need of godly legislators who will acknowledge the Lord and obey Him.<br> <br>5. <i>Ongoing warfare:</i> As warring continues, the death and wounding of our young men and women escalates. We often send brave soldiers into battle without adequate protective gear, which is absolutely unthinkable.<br> <br>6. <i>Terrorism:</i> The ever-present threat of terrorism erodes our national confidence, endangers our citizens, and jeopardizes our economy.<br> <br>7. <i>Natural disasters:</i> Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters are occurring in record-breaking numbers and strengths.<br> <br>8. <i>Abortion:</i> The problem of abortion is ongoing. More than 55 million unborn babies have been killed&#x2014;and that number is still rising.<br> <br>9. <i>Divorce:</i> The percentage of marriages that end in divorce continues to escalate.<br> <br>10. <i>Single-parent families:</i> Millions of single parents are struggling to raise their children, and the number of kids who are unable to experience a stable home life continues to rise.<br> <br>11. <i>Escalating crime:</i> Our country is experiencing a greater incidence of criminal offenses and lack of justice for victims. Law enforcement officials are frequently unable to protect citizens because of bureaucracy and legal challenges.<br> <br>12. <i>America&#x2019;s standing in the world:</i> Around the world is a rising hatred of Americans that includes the threat of nuclear proliferation by our enemies against our nation and allies.<br> <br>13. <i>Diminishing support of Israel:</i> A desire to appease political rivals has resulted in the deterioration of our national support of Israel.<br> <br>14. <i>Challenges to our Judeo-Christian values:</i> Our freedoms of religion and expression are sometimes denied&#x2014;especially when it comes to Christians who openly profess Jesus Christ as the only way to the Father.<br> <br>15. <i>Fuel availability and pricing:</i> Even though we are a nation with vast energy resources, the availability of gasoline is not assured and prices are often unpredictable.<br> <br>16. <i>Redefining of marriage:</i> Attempts to redefine marriage undermine our nation&#x2019;s morality.<br> <br>17. <i>Illegal immigration:</i> The problem of illegal immigration not only impacts our economy and safety but also creates an invisible underclass of many who may genuinely wish to be a vital and productive part of our society.<br> <br>18. <i>Toleration of immorality:</i> An increasing number of religious denominations tolerate immorality as well as accept and support sinful lifestyles even among the clergy.<br> <br>19. <i>False prophets:</i> Because of a lack of biblical literacy in our nation, more and more false prophets have arisen with heretical teachings and counterfeit &#x201c;gospels.&#x201d;<br> <br>20. <i>Need for revival:</i> One of our country&#x2019;s greatest needs is for true revival and spiritual awakening. Our nation has drifted away from God, and the name of Jesus is openly opposed by many Americans. We must return to a humble, godly reverence of our Sovereign Lord.<br> <br>It is no wonder that I feel a burden for my nation and an urgency to pray. I have absolutely no doubt that...<br> <br>ï¿½ The tides are rising.<br> <br>ï¿½ Our nation is under serious threat.<br> <br>ï¿½ If we don&#x2019;t act decisively and quickly, we will suffer loss and persecution as you and I have never experienced before.<br> <br> <b> <b>A CALL TO REVERSE THE TRENDS</b> <br> </b> <br> <br>In ancient times, before there were radars or any of the technological advancements that we&#x2019;re accustomed to today, sailors had almost no warning of incoming storms. Seafarers would set sail on open waters and take their chances in their primitive fishing vessels, with only their skills and faith to protect them. When tempests approached, churning the oceans and tossing about the ships, there was not much the sailors could do. So they would take rope and lash themselves to the mast of the boat. That way, when the wind and the waves hit the hull and thrashed against the deck, they wouldn&#x2019;t be washed overboard.<br> <br>I believe this is an example of what God wants us to do in the midst of this devastating storm. We are to lash ourselves to the Lord. We are to be in unity and oneness with Him&#x2014;securely tied to the Father because He can get us safely through this tempest.<br> Note <br> <b>If we fail to properly address these storms, they will eventually become an insurmountable tide that will erode our freedoms as citizens of the united States of america.</b> <br> <br>Right from the beginning of this book, I want to make it clear that I am calling for serious change in our nation. There are crucial issues we absolutely must address if we hope to preserve the values and principles that have made our land great. Some may believe it is impossible to change the course of our country&#x2014;that it is too immense a ship to turn around in a storm that is too difficult to survive. I agree; it is. But I also know that &#x201c;With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God&#x201d; (Mark 10:27). We <i>can</i> change our nation if we turn back to the Lord, lashing ourselves to Him and walking in oneness with Him.<br> <br>With that said, I would like to state for the record that I am a citizen of the United States of America and I love my country. It is also important to understand that I am not against government&#x2014;I believe it plays an essential role in any civilized society. For any group to be successful, it must have rules and protocols that guide how it conducts its business. This is true whether the organization is a corporation, a church, or a nation.<br> <br>Likewise, I am not trying to convince any American to become part of either a political party or the Christian denomination to which I belong. Rather, my approach has been to speak with people from all walks of life, to meet with leaders, and to do everything I can to support and defend the foundational values and principles that form the indispensible framework of our Constitution. As a Christian in the United States, I have the right&#x2014;as well as the duty&#x2014;to speak openly about matters of government, leadership, and societal trends.<br> <br>Through this book, I hope to encourage every citizen to stand up for the freedoms he or she enjoys as an American and to ensure that this liberty continues for future generations. I especially make a personal appeal to you as a Christian. I firmly believe that it is not only the privilege but the responsibility of every believer to become actively involved in the preservation of godly principles in whatever nation he or she calls home.<br> <br>Therefore, consider this book a clarion call for <i>you</i> to speak up, stand up, and pray as never before. If you desire the ungodly trends in our nation to be reversed, understand that it will happen only if you and I and others who believe as we do fight this battle on our knees before the Father and obey Him wholeheartedly. We must lash ourselves to the lord and walk in oneness with Him.<br> Note <br> <b>I hope to encourage every citizen to stand up for the freedoms he or she enjoys as an American and to ensure that this liberty continues for future generations.</b> <br> <br> <b> <b>A CALL TO PUR SUE GOD&#x2019;S HIGHEST AND BEST</b> <br> </b> <br> <br>As a Christian, you have the unique challenge of simultaneously living in two worlds. You live in this natural world, where you have responsibilities to your community and nation. You are also a citizen of the kingdom of God and are accountable to the Lord Almighty (see Philippians 3:20&#x2013;21).<br><br>Jesus readily acknowledged this duality in our lives (see Matthew 22:15&#x2013;22), but He also made these two things very clear:<br> <br>1. Our primary allegiance and responsibility is always to the Father.<br> <br>2. Our existence should impact the earth&#x2014;including our government&#x2014;by the way we live out our heavenly values. Jesus said we are to be like salt and light to this world (see Matthew 5:13&#x2013;16). We are to preserve all that is good and be obedient, godly agents of change for the Lord&#x2019;s glory and so others may be saved.<br> <br>In the vast majority of cases, we will most likely find that the choices we make concerning the current national atmosphere and the everlasting kingdom of God are not merely a matter of &#x201c;one or the other.&#x201d; We are not called to disengage from our communities to serve the Father or vice versa. Rather, God calls us to look beyond &#x201c;good&#x201d; to &#x201c;best&#x201d;&#x2014;to pursue the very highest principles and goals, whether we are here on earth influencing our leaders or enjoying eternity in heaven with Him. His desire is for us to experience life at its very best&#x2014;both in this world and the one to come.<br> Note <br> <b>God&#x2019;s desire is for us to experience life at its very best&#x2014;both in this world and the one to come.</b> <br> <br> <b> <b>A CALL TO ACT <i>NOW</i></b> <br> </b> <br> <br>In view of the storm that is assailing our nation and the rising tide that threatens to destroy the land we know and love, we have no time to spare, waste, or hesitate. The time for action is now.<br> <br> <b> <b>Scriptural warnings</b> </b> <br> <br>Throughout scripture, we find warnings from God&#x2014;given to us because He cares for and loves us. He told Israel in deuteronomy 32:46&#x2013;47, &#x201c;Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully, even all the words of this law. For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your life. And by this word you will prolong your days.&#x201d;<br> <br>His admonitions are for our good, not to hurt us or impede our progress. On the contrary, the Lord wants to protect us from harm and place us in the best possible position to receive His tremendous blessings and rewards. Therefore, the Father&#x2019;s warnings for us should be heard and obeyed with a sense of urgency.<br> <br>Likewise, we must never assume that God&#x2019;s cautions and rebukes are for...</p><h2>Much Depends on Dinner : The Extraordinary History and Mythology, Allure and Obsessions, Perils and Taboos of an Ordinary Meal</h2><p>A staple of the food-writing genre that prefigured the current locavore and foodist movements by almost two decades, Margaret Visser&#x2019;s <i>Much Depends on Dinner</i> is a delightful and intelligent history of the food we eat, and a cornucopia of incredible details about the ways we do it.<br>Presented as a meal, each chapter of Much Depends on Dinner represents a different course or garnish, which Margaret Visser handpicks from the most ordinary American dinner: corn on the cob with butter and salt, roast chicken with rice, salad dressed in lemon juice and olive oil, and ice cream. Visser tells the story behind each of these foods and in the course of her inquiries reveals some unexpected treats: the history of Corn Flakes; the secret behind the more dissatisfactory California olives (they&#x2019;re picked green, chemically blackened, and sterilized); and the fact that, in Africa, citrus fruits are eaten whole, rind and all.<br>For food lovers of all kinds, this intelligent and unexpectedly funny book is a treasure of information that sheds light on one of our favorite pastimes: eating.</p><p>In this immensely learned and attractive book, Visser gives a chapter to each of the nine ingredients of a simple dinner: corn with salt and butter, chicken with rice, lettuce with olive oil and lemon juice, ice cream. Each of these foods has a "weird, passionate, often savage history of its own," which she relates in spirited prose, rich in surprising facts, unexpected connections, and a well-documented outrage at what modern technology and agribusiness have done to purity and quality. This presents a remarkable amount of information seamlessly and entertainingly.

A splendid introduction to P. G. Wodehouse's most popular characters, these comic gems recount Bertie's reluctant involvement in Bingo's misadventures and Jeeves' uncanny ability to rescue his employer from every scrape.<br>In the opening entry, "Jeeves Exerts the Old Cerebellum," Bingo seeks help in persuading his wealthy guardian to accept his socially undesirable fiancï¿½e. Mabel the waitress is only the first in a succession of Bingo's romantic interests, which include a parson's niece, a Communist, and Bertie's own fiancï¿½e&#x2014;among others. Eighteen connected stories trace Bingo and Bertie's shenanigans at home and abroad and introduce assorted Wooster relatives, from the terrifying Aunt Agatha to Claude and Eustace, the fun-loving, trouble-making twins. The collection is particularly distinguished by the inclusion of a Wodehouse masterpiece, "The Great Sermon Handicap," in which bets are placed on the length of a Sunday oration and hilarity ensues.</p><p>In the course of his long career, Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (1881&#x2013;1975) published more than 90 books, 40 plays, and 200 short stories, in addition to other writings. A century after their debut, his comic duo of aristocratic Bertie Wooster and all-knowing manservant Jeeves rank among Wodehouse's most popular creations.</p><h2>New England Open-House Cookbook: 300 Recipes Inspired by the Bounty of New England</h2><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve adored Sarah Chase&#x2019;s cookbooks for decades!

The river and its fish have supported indigenous peoples for thousands of years. More recently, the Skeena has earned world renown for its recreational fishery and magnificent wilderness setting. Yet, over the last century, fish populations have declined from overfishing, habitat alteration and, to an unknown degree, climate change. Development of mining as well as oil and gas resources may also pose threats to fish populations.This book presents the first thorough review of the salmon stocks and freshwater species of the Skeena River. Initial chapters summarize the river&#x2019;s environment, fish, and fisheries. The book then examines the physical geography, development history, indigenous use, and major salmon stocks of each of the watershed&#x2019;s sub-basins. This volume makes available for the first time&#x2014;to researchers, field biologists, fishermen and natural history enthusiasts&#x2014;both the published, and largely unpublished, literature on this productive salmon ecosystem.</p><p>British Columbia&#x2019;s Skeena River is one of the great salmon rivers of the North Pacific.

Olivia, a ward of the county, had lived in ten different foster and group homes by the time she was sixteen. Sadi, who grew up as a gangbanger, has seen three of his homies die and numerous others go to jail. Stories such as these are part of everyday life for the gifted students of Crenshaw High School.</p><p>Toya, Olivia and Sadi are just three of the twelve remarkable young people depicted in <em>And Still We Rise</em>. Miles Corwin, author of <em>The Killing Season </em>and journalist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, spent a year in the classroom with these kids, ghetto scholars who qualified for an elite gifted program because of their exceptional IQs and standardized test scores. Corwin recorded their journey as they fought their own private wars on the chance that they might one day attend college.</p><p>Corwin sat alongside them as they studied William Shakespeare and James Joyce in classrooms where bullets were known to rip through windows. But for these students, the physical landscape was not their only battleground: Caught in the political crossfire, they face an uncertain future as the last high school senior class to benefit from affirmative action. What's more, the teacher they depend on most alternates between inspired lecturing and bitter ranting about an administration she perceives as the enemy.</p><p>Before the end of the year, one of these students will be arrested. Another will drop out of school because she's pregnant. Still, they won't give up. Many of these bright and persistent students will graduate, and, against all odds, win scholarships to college.</p><p><em>And Still We Rise </em>is an unforgettable story of how twelve students manage to transcend obstacles that would dash the hopes of any but the most exceptional spirits.</p>Author and journalist Miles Corwin spent the entire 1996-97 school year with a remarkable group of individuals: the students in the senior Advanced Placement English class at Crenshaw High School -- young ghetto scholars who have managed to excel despite living in the hostile world of South Central Los Angeles. This book is a moving account of their courage, achievements, strength, and resilient spirit -- their personal crises, setbacks, catastrophes, and triumphs. It is an unforgettable ten-month visit to the dynamic, electrically charged classroom of Toni Little, an inspiring but volatile and wildly unpredictable white educator determined to imbue her minority students with a passion for great literature. Corwin also spent the year with Anita "Mama" Moultrie, a flamboyant black teacher whose Afrocentric teaching style was diametrically opposed to Little's traditional approach. These exceptional students -- all classified as gifted -- provide a ground zero perspective on the affirmative action debate and will remain with the readers always.Author and journalist Miles Corwin spent the entire 1996-97 school year with a remarkable group of individuals: the students in the senior Advanced Placement English class at Crenshaw High School---young ghetto scholars who have managed to excel despite living in the hostile world of South Central Los Angeles.

These exceptional students---all classified as gifted---provide a ground zero perspective on the affirmative action debate and will remain with the readers always.</p><p>The typical image of South-Central Los Angeles doesn't lend itself to peaceful and productive high schools. But as <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Miles Corwin chronicles in this troubling yet uplifting book, the ills of the inner city have not completely defeated Toni Little's advanced-placement students at Crenshaw High School, with whom Corwin spent the 1996-1997 academic year as a silent observer. Having grown weary of writing about gang violence, drive-by shootings, and drug arrests, Corwin wanted "to find a way to write about the other children of South-Central, the students who avoid the temptations of the street, who strive for success, who, against all odds, in one of America's most impoverished, crime-ridden neighborhoods, manage to endure, to prevail, to succeed." He also wanted to show "how truly slanted the playing field remains, how inequality is built into a system touted as a meritocracy." Though 98 percent of the students in the gifted program go on to attend college, it takes a near superhuman effort for them to reach graduation day. In <i>And Still We Rise</i>, Corwin details exactly why.<p> Corwin's poignant portraits of the students and his sensitive evocation of the effort it requires for them to pursue their education are among the many strengths of the book. There's Olivia, the abused former runaway, ward of the county, and gifted student; Sadikifu, the promising Muslim rapper who constantly fights the gritty allure of gang life; and Toya, who lost her own mom to domestic violence and who struggles to balance schoolwork and motherhood. Corwin further explores the intricate intersections of affirmative action, educational expectations, urban neglect, and racism. By turns shocking and inspiring, this is journalistic work that gets to the core of its subject to reveal students who "value education, sacrifice much to further their educations, and overcome many obstacles--including even their own teachers--in order to obtain their educations." It shouldn't be so hard. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>A native of Los Angeles, Miles Corwin is an award-winning reporter for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and the author of the critically acclaimed <em>The Killing Season,</em> a national bestseller.

Perhaps no Hebrew prophet speaks so directly to our time as Jeremiah. Perhaps no contemporary can unveil his message and warning as can Daniel Berrigan, whose eloquence and courage, like Jeremiah&#39;s, expose the corruption of religious commitment, address national trauma and uncertainty, and proclaim the requirements of true lament and resolve.</p><p></p><h2>Freedom and Its Betrayal : Six Enemies of Human Liberty</h2><p>Isaiah Berlin&#39;s celebrated radio lectures on six important anti-liberal thinkers were delivered on the BBC&#39;s &#34;Third Programme&#34; in 1952. They are published here for the first time, 50 years on. &#34;Freedom and its Betrayal&#34; is one of Isaiah Berlin&#39;s earliest and most convincing expositions of his views on human freedom and the history of ideas, views which later found expression in such works as &#34;Two Concepts of Liberty&#34;, and were at the heart of his lifelong work on the Enlightenment and its critics. In his examinations of sometimes difficult ideas, Berlin demonstrates that a balanced understanding and a resilient defence of human liberty depend on learning both from the errors of freedom&#39;s defenders and from the dark insights of its antagonists. This book throws light on the early development of Berlin&#39;s ideas, and supplements his already published writings with fuller treatments of Helvetius, Rousseau, Fichte, Hegel and Saint-Simon, with the ultra-conservative traditionalist Maistre bringing up the rear. It shows Berlin at his liveliest and most torrentially spontaneous, testifying to his talents as a teacher of rare brilliance and impact.</p><p>The Isaiah Berlin lectures collected in this volume were originally aired on BBC radio in 1952. They appear here in print for the first time, thanks to editor Henry Hardy, who produced these fine essays from BBC transcripts and Berlin's own notes. It is perhaps better to read Berlin than hear him; as Hardy points out in his introduction, the late thinker had the unfortunate habit of speaking rapidly. A contemporary once said he was "the only man who pronounces 'epistemological' as one syllable." Yet they are a joy to have in any form, as Berlin is a clear and crisp communicator of ideas. Political theory is not always the most engaging subject matter, but on these pages Berlin makes it accessible as he probes the legacies of "six thinkers who were hostile to liberty"--namely Helvetus, Rousseau, Fichte, Hegel, Saint-Simon, and Maistre. He doesn't exactly beat around the bush. Rousseau, he writes, "claims to have been the most ardent and passionate lover of human liberty who ever lived." But Berlin's own verdict is quite different: He "was one of the most sinister and most formidable enemies of liberty in the whole history of modern thought." Reading these jarring essays is like listening to a favorite college professor lecture on a topic he knows well. <i>--John Miller</i><br> <p>"[Berlin's] lecturing style . . . proved enormously successful as broadcasting. . . . [H]undreds of thousands of people tuned in . . . to listen to fiendishly difficult hour-long talks, delivered in clipped, rapid-fire Oxford accent. These were the lectures that led Eliot, in his barbed way, to congratulate Isaiah for his 'torrential eloquence'; and the conservative Michael Oakeshotte to praise him, in equally barbed fashion, as 'the Paganini of the platform'. . . . The conventional signs of public attention poured in: anonymous ladies knitted him red socks; cranks sent him manuscripts. . . . The head of [the BBC's] Radio 3 hailed the talks as a landmark in British broadcasting, and they were certainly a landmark in Berlin's life. The search to find his own intellectual vocation had been a central preoccupation since his return from the war. With the broadcast of 'Freedom and Its Betrayal,' that struggle resolved itself. . . . He had become a public intellectual--in the Russian mould, but in an English idiom."<b>--Michael Ignatieff, <i>Isaiah Berlin: A Life</i><br> </b><br> </p><br> <p>"This is one of the most important books on the history of ideas in Berlin's oeuvre. The lectures are clearer than many of his later writings and are extremely compelling. Berlin was convinced that, for all its praise of liberty, the Enlightenment was in fact hostile to it, and that the Counter-Enlightenment offered sounder intellectual grounds for defending and extending liberty. Even those who disagree with this diagnosis of modern thought will have to confront it."<b>--Mark Lilla, University of Chicago</b><br> </p><br></p><h2>Tomorrow&#39;s Gold: Asia&#39;s age of discovery</h2><p>Renowned investment advisor Marc Faber sets out to find tomorrow s gold the outperforming asset classes of the future.

As a teen, he led a group of four friends to beat a local bully to death and let someone else take the rap. David has managed to avoid every bad break, but in a life of big money payoffs, potentially lethal pitfalls, and legal wrangling, fate is bound to get the upper hand at least once.</p><p>Born in New York City, Harold Robbins is one of the world&#39;s bestselling authors, writing novels that often mirrored his own experiences and that were peopled by charcacters he had met.&nbsp; Never Enough<br>ONESATURDAY EVENING, APRIL 20,1974Four of them were together that Saturday evening: Dave Shea, Cole Jennings, Bill Morris, and Tony DeFelice. These four had minor reputations as more than troublemakers.Dave Shea was a handsome young man, tall and muscular, a football player. He was very charismatic. Every girl&#x2019;s dream was to date Dave Shea. He had been his school&#x2019;s quarterback for two years, during which his team lost only one game. In his senior year the team went undefeated. Besides that, he was an outstanding scholar. He was inducted into the National Honor Society in his junior year. His special subjects were mathematics, chemistry, and physics. As of April he had accepted a football scholarship at Rutgers University. Without the scholarship he would have been unable to go to college. But he had the scholarship and his future seemed assured.But he had a dark side. It wasn&#x2019;t alcohol. The fact was that Dave was a <i>cheat.</i> He did it on the football field, where he had an exceptional talent for knowing when officials weren&#x2019;t looking and then clipping, face-mask violations, even for punching an opposing player in the nose. In close contact with a defensive lineman, he started his &#x201c;trash talk.&#x201d; Calling people names until he would get them to react. A trick that could get a star defense man ejected from the game, while Dave stood gaping and shaking his head, wondering what had caused the foul. In the chemistry lab he knew what results were expected from a problem in qualitative analysis and pretended to have achieved that result, when he really hadn&#x2019;t. He was in fact a good player and a good student, but he had his little tricks to make himself look even better.&#x201c;You&#x2019;re good enough, Shea,&#x201d; Cole said one day. &#x201c;Why not play it straight ... ?&#x201d;&#x201c;Look, Jennings. Your family will send you to college, no matter what. You&#x2019;re smart, too, but you don&#x2019;t need a scholarship. I <i>do.</i> I have to cover myself ... be better than good ...&#x201d;&#x201c;Gotcha. But you <i>are</i> good enough!&#x201d;&#x201c;Yeah? Well, I&#x2019;m looking for a little insurance on it.

They add up their nickels every month, hopin&#x2019; there&#x2019;s enough to make the payment on the car. I don&#x2019;t want to live like that, Jennings!&#x201d;He didn&#x2019;t want to live without sex either. He first shoved his big penis into a girl when he was thirteen years old.She was seventeen.&#x201c;Jesus Christ! The guys said you&#x2019;re ... Hey, I can&#x2019;t take all that, Shea.&#x201d;&#x201c;Bet ya can,&#x201d; he said, with a hard-on that ached for release.He began to enter her slowly until he was buried deep inside her.&#x201c;God almighty! Hey! I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it!&#x201d;Eventually, Amy, who also declared she couldn&#x2019;t possibly, did. And complained it hurt. But he couldn&#x2019;t get enough, and after the first time neither could she.Cole Jennings played basketball and was good at it. He was tall, six feet six, and had an indefinable agility on the polished floor that brought him recognition as a valuable player. His blond hair fell over his forehead as he dribbled toward the basket, dodging this way and that, avoiding the players trying to guard him, until at the last moment he passed the ball to a teammate close to the goal and charged in to take the rebound if the shot missed. He made most of his points by capturing rebounds and jamming the ball through the basket.He, too, was an excellent student. One of them, Dave or Cole, would be valedictorian of their high school class.As Dave had suggested, Cole did not need a scholarship, athletic or academic, to go to college. His father was senior partner in a major realty firm. His family could and would pay his tuition at any school he wanted to attend.From the time he was old enough to drive, Cole had his own car. That night he was driving his graduation present, already given him though graduation was seven weeks away. It was a black Pontiac TransAm. His parents had always indulged their son. His graduation was no exception.Cole was a responsible, thoughtful young man, and even if he could burn rubber he didn&#x2019;t. Conservative, compared to Dave.Dave envied Cole when he saw the beautiful black TransAm. Someday, he thought ... someday ... but he never even got to drive his father&#x2019;s old Chevy. That car was too important to making a living for his father to allow his son to drive it.Bill Morris played both football and basketball, though he was not the star that Dave and Cole were. He spent most of his time on the bench. Even so, he &#x201c;went out&#x201d; for sports and was considered a jock. All of these four were. He was not the scholar his two friends were, either; and his parents had been squirreling away money for years, in anticipation of his college tuition. Bill would not win a scholarship.He was a solid young man, not heavy enough for football and not tall enough for basketball. On the basketball floor he wore plastic-rimmed eyeglasses held in place by a rubber strap behind his head. On the football field he wore no glasses and relied on a slightly blurry vision of the developing play. Since he was a guard and all but invariably was blocked after he did or did not block <i>his</i> man, it made little difference. He was dark-haired, and oddly was already showing, on his forehead, the initial evidence of baldness.Of the four, many would have called Tony DeFelice the one most likely to succeed. They were all jocks, but Tony was a jock in a very different sense. He was a Golden Gloves boxer with a promising future.He was a welterweight, knife-thin, with muscles as hard as the steel of a knife. Many were afraid of him, but he had been trained to restrain himself and never use his boxing skills outside the ring. His ambition was to go to the Olympics and then to turn professional.He was an extremely intense young man, with hard eyes. People who knew him well were aware that he had a ready sense of humor and found amusement in all manner of things and people.His family owned a score of packer trucks and collected trash and garbage over a wide area of Bergen County. They were said to be &#x201c;connected.&#x201d; They were a family of shrewd, hardworking Italian immigrants, who had hauled first in a single mule-drawn wagon and had gradually worked their way up to the considerable business they now owned.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On this humid April Saturday night it was the same old thing: nothing to do. They were silent as they listened to Bruce Springsteen sing his latest hit. The four boys had bought six-packs of beer and drunk twenty bottles between them. The remaining four bottles were on the floor of the backseat of Cole&#x2019;s car. A little after ten Cole drove into the parking lot of Pizza Palace on the edge of Wyckoff.The Palace might more realistically have been called the shack. It had only four small tables. Customers were expected to take delivery of their pizzas and drive them home. The boys ordered two pizzas and returned to the car to wait the twenty minutes until their pizzas would be ready. They opened their last four bottles of beer and talked about whether or not they should drive off during the twenty minutes and buy another six-pack or two.They had sat there, drinking their last beers and talking aimlessly when Jim Amos came alongside the car.&#x201c;Well, if it ain&#x2019;t Slaw,&#x201d; he said in a beer-slurred voice. Slaw was a nickname sometimes fastened on Cole. He didn&#x2019;t like it, but he didn&#x2019;t make an issue of it. &#x201c;New wheels, Slaw?&#x201d; Amos goaded.Amos was twenty-four years old and had served four years in the United States Navy. He was known in the town and area as a drunk and a bully. He would walk up to a smaller and younger boy on the street and ask him what was the finest service in the United States Armed Forces. The boy might not know that Amos had been in the navy and might say United States Marines or something else. If he didn&#x2019;t say navy, Amos might deck him.Or he might say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong, and I&#x2019;ll let you buy me a few drinks to make up for it.&#x201d;In any case, Jim Amos was a bully. He&#x2019;d been beaten up two or three times, for having taken a swing at the wrong man; but that had not discouraged him, and he remained a two-bit punk, looking for someone to intimidate.Tonight he was feeling aggressive.&#x201c;Slaw and his Three Muskeeters. Mommy and Daddy get this for baby boy?&#x201d; he said as he hopped up on the fender and sat.Dave came out of the passenger side, fast, and rushed around the car. &#x201c;Get your ass down from there, Amos,&#x201d; he yelled.&#x201c;Y&#x2019; gonna make me?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna make you.&#x201d;Cole was out of the car now, followed by Bill and Tony from the backseat.&#x201c;Oh. All four of you. Fine. Suits me. Who&#x2019;s first?&#x201d;Dave grabbed Amos by the legs and threw him off the fender, onto the gravel of the parking lot. Amos was drunk, but he was quick and strong. He scrambled up and charged Dave, throwing a shoulder against his chest and knocking him back against the car, where he was vulnerable to the punch to the chin that Amos threw. Dave was dazed for a second.Amos set himself to throw more punches to Dave&#x2019;s face and down one of his opponents. But Cole grabbed him from behind and wrestled him away. He punched him hard on the kidneys.Amos broke out of Cole&#x2019;s grip, turned, and punched him in the stomach. Cole doubled over and vomited beer.Bill stunned Amos with a hard punch to the ear.Dave had gained his sense with a fury. As Amos was momentarily disoriented, Dave shot a hard fist against his nose, which collapsed in a spray of blood. Amos shook his head and moaned. His knees began to buckle. He was finished.But Dave&#x2019;s anger was not assuaged. He stepped up to the staggering Amos and put every ounce of his weight and strength into a crushing blow to Amos&#x2019;s jaw. Amos dropped backward to the gravel. His head hit with a sickening crunch.The police arrived a moment later. One of the officers knelt beside Amos and examined him.&#x201c;This man is dead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The families gathered at the Bergen County Jail.The Sheas were frightened. Dave&#x2019;s mother was weeping, and his father&#x2019;s lips trembled. &#x201c;That poor boy! That <i>poor</i> boy!&#x201d; Mrs. Shea kept murmuring through her tears. She meant Jim Amos.The Jennings family was grimly composed. Stuart Jennings was prepared to confront trouble and had summoned his lawyer.The Morrises seemed not to comprehend what was going on. Their faces were blank, as though they were in shock, which in fact they were.Anthony DeFelice glowered. When his father arrived he told him to keep his mouth shut and slapped him on the side of the head.Witnesses from Pizza Palace assembled to give statements. None of the witnesses was quite sure what had happened, except that all agreed Tony DeFelice had not hit Amos.From that point, all was confusion.&#x201c;Those three there, they all hit him. I seen &#x2019;em,&#x201d; an old man with a three-day stubble of white whiskers declared.&#x201c;It was self-defense,&#x201d; Dave asserted angrily.&#x201c;Three of you? Self-defense against <i>one feller</i>?&#x201d;A fat girl spoke. &#x201c;Jim Amos was a drunken bully. He was always starting fights.&#x201d;&#x201c;We know that,&#x201d; said the chief of police. He was a muscular, middle-aged man in a tan uniform. &#x201c;On the other hand ... well&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; said the old man. &#x201c;An&#x2019; three of &#x2019;em were beatin&#x2019; up on &#x2019;im.&#x201d;&#x201c;Which one of you swung the punch that broke his neck?&#x201d; asked the chief of police.&#x201c;Uh ... just a moment,&#x201d; said a white-haired man with a flushed face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to advise these boys not to answer that question, or any others, until they&#x2019;ve had a chance to consult with counsel.&#x201d;The white-haired man was Lloyd Paul Strecker. He was attorney for the Jenningses and had arrived at the police station before they did. He had a formidable reputation in Bergen County, not just for being a tough lawyer but for his political connections.An assistant district attorney arrived. Her name was Lela Goldish, and she was about thirty years old, an attractive young woman, with broad hips and a prominent ass. She was also hyper, moved in jerks and spoke in clipped sentences.&#x201c;What&#x2019;ve we got here?&#x201d; she asked.The chief of police gave her a brief statement.&#x201c;Manslaughter,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Maybe involuntary manslaughter. Sure as hell not murder.&#x201d;&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Strecker. &#x201c;I think these boys should be given a chance to confer among themselves. They are all involved. They should sing from the same sheet.&#x201d;No one disagreed. Dave, Cole, Bill, and Tony went into a little conference room to talk.Dave put his elbows on the table and his face in his hands. &#x201c;Shit ...&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the end for me. Manslaughter charge. There goes my scholarship. There goes my fuckin&#x2019; life. Even if I don&#x2019;t go to the slammer, Rutgers won&#x2019;t want me. It&#x2019;s the end!&#x201d; He looked grim.&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to hit him that last time,&#x201d; said Cole. &#x201c;We had him. He was finished.&#x201d;&#x201c;I was ... pissed,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;The <i>son of a bitch ...</i>&#x201d;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re the witnesses,&#x201d; said Tony calmly. &#x201c;Whatever we say happened, happened. Self-defense.&#x201d;&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t buy that,&#x201d; Dave muttered. &#x201c;Four of us ...&#x201d;&#x201c;Only the guy that shot the last punch,&#x201d; said Bill Morris. &#x201c;He was out. The guy that&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Yeah, sure, Morris,&#x201d; said Dave. &#x201c;I killed him.&#x201d;&#x201c;Jesus, man,&#x201d; said Cole. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s gonna go tough for you. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll get a big sentence, but&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;What the fuck does it matter!&#x201d; Dave glared. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wind up like my old man. A nobody.&#x201d;&#x201c;We oughta talk to the lawyer,&#x201d; said Tony.They asked Strecker to come in.&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where it stands,&#x201d; he told them immediately. &#x201c;We can make it involuntary manslaughter. The man who threw the last punch can plead guilty to that. He&#x2019;ll get probation.&#x201d;&#x201c;But he&#x2019;ll have a felony record,&#x201d; said Dave despondently.&#x201c;Well ... actually, that can be expunged from the records in a few years. It won&#x2019;t prevent a man from getting into law school, for example&#x2014;because the record won&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d;&#x201c;But right now&#x2014;&#x201d; Dave muttered disconsolately.&#x201c;For a while it will be an impediment,&#x201d; said Strecker.&#x201c;An impediment that&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Can ruin his whole life,&#x201d; said Cole sadly.&#x201c;I see where this is going,&#x201d; said the lawyer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to leave you boys to talk together.&#x201d;With the lawyer out of the room, the four boys sat silent for a full minute. Then&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the one with the most to lose,&#x201d; said Dave. &#x201c;You guys are going to college because your families can pay for it. Mine can&#x2019;t. My scholarship is the only way I&#x2019;m going to get a college education. The only goddamned way.&#x201d;&#x201c;What you&#x2019;re saying,&#x201d; said Tony, &#x201c;is that one of <i>us</i> should confess he shot the last punch.&#x201d;Dave closed his eyes and nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only one whose life is on the line.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go this far,&#x201d; said Tony coldly. &#x201c;If one of these guys wants to take it, I won&#x2019;t screw it up. I won&#x2019;t tell the truth.&#x201d;Dave looked at Cole. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got the <i>least</i> to lose. You&#x2019;re going to whatever university you choose, because your family will pay for it. You&#x2019;ve got a first-class lawyer. Your family and your lawyer have got political connections. You can come out of this smelling like roses. <i>I</i> come out piled...</p><h2>Sisters: The Story of Olivia De Havilland and Joan Fontaine</h2><p>A candid portrait of the lives and careers of actresses Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine traces their lifelong competition and jealousy for each other</p><p></p><h2>Shadows over Lyra</h2><p>The magical world of Lyra, an enchanted place populated by humans, forest-dwelling Wyrdsd, Shee, watery Neira, and the powerful and evil Shadow-born, comes alive in an omnibus edition containing three early Lyra novels--Shadow Magic, Daughter of Witches, and The Harp of Imach Thyssel.

It is a well-thought-out, philosophically conceived, developmentally based, and research-supported method of helping children cope with and overcome the problems they experience in the process of living their lives. Concise digests of play therapy procedures explore the most difficult, as well as the most common problems encountered by play therapists. These digests cover play therapy approaches based on a variety of theoretical positions for dealing with a broad range of specific problems. Because they often do not have access to substantiated results, play therapists sometimes doubt themselves and the effectiveness of their work.

She lives in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.Kindergarten-Grade 3-In a story set in 1815, Mary and Jonathan McClure join their parents and numerous other families on an adventurous journey down the Ohio River. The McClures have been patiently waiting for winter's end aboard a loaded flatboat by a riverbank in Pittsburgh. Spring thaw makes travel on the river possible again; they set off, looking forward to a new life on fertile land in the territory that was to become Indiana. Sanders has written a descriptive narrative of these courageous people who loaded all their possessions, tools, animals, and family onto a flatboat or raft bound for a new home on unsettled land. The daily struggles and triumphs on the river are effectively portrayed throughout the narrative. Watercolor paintings in shades of blues, greens, and browns complete the historical perspective, detailing just about every aspect of this hardworking life. In addition, the children's sense of wonder, anticipation, and excitement is clearly defined through both text and illustrations.

On the slopes of Vesuvius, he tracks the history of the region down through the centuries?to volcanic eruptions seen by fifteenth-century Italians, the Romans, and, from striking geological evidence, even Neolithic man. As story adds to story, the recent past connects with forgotten ages long ago, then much longer ago, as he describes the movement of plates and the development of ancient continents and seas.

In parts of Naples, all you see are lines of washing draped from the balconies of peeling tenements or hastily constructed apartment blocks: the mountain has apparently vanished. You can understand how it might be possible to live life in that city only half aware of the volcano on whose slopes your home is constructed, and whose whim might control your continued existence.<br><br> As you drive eastwards from the centre of the city, the packed streets give way to a chaotic patchwork of anonymous buildings, small factories, and ugly housing on three or four floors. The road traffic is relentless. Yet between the buildings there are tended fields and shaded greenhouses. In early March the almonds are in flower, delicately pink, and there are washes of bright daffodils beneath the orchard trees; you can see women gathering them for market. In the greenhouses exotic flowers such as canna lilies can be glimpsed, or ranks of potted plants destined for the supermarket trade. Oranges and lemons are everywhere. Even the meanest corner will have one or two citrus trees, fenced in and padlocked against thieves. The lemons hang down heavily, as if they were too great a burden for the thin twigs that carry them. The soil is marvellously rich: with enough water, crops would grow and grow.<br><br> This was an abundant garden in Roman times, and it still is, even if crammed between scruffy apartments and scrap-metal yards. Volcanic soil is rich in minerals; it is correspondingly generous to crops. Outside the city, Vesuvius is more of a continuous presence; the ground rises gently towards its brown summit. New buildings cling on to the side of the mountain, even high up among the low trees and broom bushes that clothe its flanks. The buildings are indistinct, however, hidden by a creamy-yellow haze of petrochemical smog spreading outwards from the frantic centre of Naples towards the mountainside. You pass a road sign to Pompeii, but from the road there is little to distinguish this suburb from any other, for all its fame.<br><br> When the road rises into the hills that abut the southern margin of the Bay of Naples, the urban sprawl begins to thin out. The orange groves are more orderly, with the trees neatly planted in rows inside cages made of makeshift wooden struts, draped over the top with nets. The slopes become much steeper than on the volcanic flanks&#x2014;close terraces piled one upon the other, each banked up with a wall of pale limestone blocks. Medium-sized trees with small grey-green leaves&#x2014;which appear almost silvery in the afternoon light&#x2014;cling to the most precipitous terraces. These are olive trees, the definitive Mediterranean survivors, oil producers and suppliers of piquant fruit. Their deep roots can seek out the narrowest cracks. They relish limestone soils, however poor they are in comparison with volcanic loam. The villages in this part of the bay are as you would expect of regular, tourist Italy, with piazzas and ristorante-pizzerias and youths with slick hairstyles on the lookout for a fast buck. Even this long before the summer season there is opportunity for a smooth operator. You find yourself agreeing to hire a cab for a day for Â¬200 to hug the congested roads, when you could travel faster on the excellent Circumvesuviana railway for a tiny fraction of the price. Somehow, you, the visitor, have become the rich volcanic soil primed to yield a good harvest.<br><br> Near the tip of the southern peninsula, Sorrento commands a wonderful prospect of Mount Vesuvius across the entire Bay of Naples. From this steep-sided town, Vesuvius looks almost the perfect, gentle-sided cone. It could be a domestic version of Mount Fuji, the revered volcanic mountain in Japan. It can appear blue, or grey, or occasionally stand revealed in its true brown colours. On clear days Vesuvius is starkly outlined against a bright sky: a dark, heavy, almost oppressive presence. Or on a misty morning its conical summit can rise above a mere sketch or impression of the lower slopes, which are obscured in vapour, as if it were cut off from the world to make a house for the gods alone. At night, ranks of lights along Neapolitan roads twinkle incessantly. Vesuvius is often no more than a dark shape against a paler, but still Prussian blue sky. The lights might persuade you that the mountain was still in the process of eruption, with points of white illumination tracking lava flows running down the hillsides. From Sorrento, you can make of Vesuvius what you will, for within a day it will have remade itself.<br><br> The Bay of Naples is where the science of geology started. The description of the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii in a.d. 79 by Pliny the Younger is probably the first clear and objective description of a geological phenomenon. No dragons were invoked, no clashes between the Titans and the gods. Pliny provided observation, not speculation.<br><br> Not quite two millennia later, in 1830, Charles Lyell was to use an illustration of columns from the so-called Temple of Serapis at Pozzuoli, north of Naples, as the frontispiece to volume 1 of the most seminal work in geology&#x2014;his Principles of Geology. This book influenced the young Charles Darwin more than any other source in his formulation of evolutionary theory: so you could say that the Bay of Naples had its part to play, too, in the most important biological revolution. Everybody who was anybody in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries visited the bay, and marvelled at its natural and archaeological phenomena. For geology&#x2014;a latecomer to the pantheon of sciences&#x2014;the area is the nearest thing to holy ground that there is. If you were going to choose anywhere to retrace the growth in our understanding about how the earth is constructed, what better place to begin? Where else more appropriate to explain first principles? The long intellectual journey that eventually led to plate tectonics started in this bite out of the western shin of Italy&#x2019;s boot-shaped profile. A voyage around this particular bay is a pilgrimage to the foundations of comprehension about our planet.<br><br> Everything about Sorrento is rooted in the geology. The town itself is in a broad valley surrounded by limestone ranges, which flash white bluffs on the hillsides and reach the sea in nearly vertical cliffs&#x2014;an incitement to dizziness for those brave enough to look straight down from the top. Seen from a distance, the roads that wind up the sides of the hills look like folded tagliatelle. Stacked blocks of the same limestone are used in the walls that underpin the terraces supporting the olive groves. In special places there are springs that spurt out fresh, cool water from underground caverns. These sources are often flanked by niches containing the statue of a saint, or of the Virgin: water is not taken for granted in these parts. There are deep ravines through the limestone hills, probably marking where caves have collapsed. The country backing the Bay of Naples is known as Campania, and the same name, Campanian, is applied to a subdivision of geological time belonging to the Cretaceous period. If you look carefully on some of the weathered surfaces of the limestones, you will see the remains of seashells that were alive in the age of the dinosaurs. I saw some obvious clams and sea urchins, belonging to extinct species, emerging from the cliffs as if they were on a bas-relief. A palaeontologist can identify the individual fossil species, and use them to calibrate the age of the rocks, since the succession of species is a measure of geological time. The implication is clear enough: in Cretaceous times all these hilly regions were beneath a shallow, warm sea. Limy muds accumulated there as sediments, and entombed the remains of the animals living on the sea floor. Time and burial hardened the muds into the tough limestones we see today. They are sedimentary rocks, subsequently uplifted to become land; earth movements then tilted them&#x2014;but this is to anticipate. What one can say is that the character of the limestone hills is a product of an ancient sea.<br><br> The massive limestones continue westwards on to the island of Capri, which is a twenty-minute ferry ride from Sorrento and bounds the southern edge of the Bay of Naples. The island rises sheer from the sea, circumscribed by steep limestone cliffs, and your first thought is how could it support the smallest village, let alone a town. The town of Capri lies at the top of a vertiginous funicular railway running from the harbour. The buildings are ancient and quaint, and, naturally enough, built of the local stone. The blocks themselves are often concealed under stucco. There is a fine medieval charterhouse where the pale limestone is put to good effect in columns supporting cloisters. Almost everything else is fabricated of limestone&#x2014;walls, floors, piazzas. In the bright Mediterranean light there is an overwhelming sense of whiteness; some of the villas glimpsed on the hillside have the appearance of frosted cakes tucked under umbrella pines. Only dark basalt must have been imported from Vesuvius to make the surfaces of the streets: this volcanic rock is less liable to shatter than limestone. It is not difficult to imagine the racket that iron-rimmed wheels made as they clattered over these roughly matched, large blocks. On the inner side of the island there are truly astonishing vertical limestone cliffs dropping hundreds of metres to the sea. The Roman Emperor Tiberius spent his declining years in a palace on the island, the ruins of which endure. According to the prurient accounts of his chronicler Suetonius...</p><h2>The wild Irish girl (Mothers of the novel)</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos, missing text or index.

There's a reason: it's gorgeous. The photos of trails and vistas are breathtaking. These are hikes you will want to hike, dream about hiking, or both. Based on their more than 100 years of combined experience in Washington's backcountry, Ira Spring and Harvey Manning chose their favorite trails for this compendium of classic hikes.<br>Along with the images and hand-drawn maps, you'll get the authors' first-hand descriptions of the trails they hiked many times over. Featuring spectacular views, flower-filled alpine meadows, lakes and streams, ancient forests, animals and birds, and solitude, these trails will give hikers a taste of Washington's best. Infused with a strong conservation message, this guidebook not only introduces hikers to Washington's gems but encourages them to become active participants in an effort to preserve and, in some cases, reclaim the remaining wilderness.<br></p><p><i>Classic Hikes</i> is a greatest hits of previous Mountaineers guidebooks for Washington, collecting in a single volume 100 hikes from the guides to the Alpine Lakes, North Cascades, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, and South Cascades and Olympics regions. The intelligence behind the selection comes from Ira Spring and Harvey Manning, who between them have more than 100 years of hiking experience in Washington. Owners of other Mountaineers guides will notice that the production values of this volume are even higher than usual; color maps and photos adorn high-quality (recycled) paper. At-a-glance information for easy browsing includes the following: mileage, suggested duration in hours or days, high point, elevation gain, seasonality, topo map codes, and additional contact information. The text synopses are colorful and politically opinionated (woe to the dirt biker who crosses paths with these two!). Their sense of tradition is also readily apparent: "To start with the ice cream and work through the meatballs and potatoes to the soup is not esthetic. Coming to the Enchantments by way of Aasgard is in very bad taste."<p> While avid hikers will have plenty to argue about concerning the sins of omission, it's hard to argue with the inclusion of Mount Rainier's Wonderland Trail, Whatcom Pass in the North Cascades, Image Lake in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, the Enchantments in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and the Olympics' High Divide. These represent some of the most spectacular hikes in North America. The downside is that you're not likely to find solitude in such places, no matter how remote. But there are 95 more trails to choose from, many of similar scenic beauty and slightly less fame.</p>Worth purchasing for the photos alone. -- <i>The News Tribune [Tacoma, WA]</i></p><h2>When I Lived in Modern Times</h2><p><p>It is April 1946.

When British ships failed to capture America's Fort Bowyer on the Gulf of Mexico, their Indian allies sensed disaster and scattered into the wooded countryside.</p><p></p><p>Outside Pensacola, Jackson decided he could not wait for authorization from Washington and called for reinforcements from Tennessee. The afternoon of November 6, 1814, with three thousand men in camp, he sent a flag of truce to Governor Gonzalez Manrique, along with an explanation that he had not come to attack a neutral power or to damage Pensacola but simply to prevent the British from using the town as a haven. Jackson called for the surrender of two nearby forts where British and Spanish flags had been flying together.</p><p></p><p>As Jackson's emissary approached with his flag of truce, he was driven back by cannon shot. When Jackson demanded an explanation, Gonzalez Manrique apologized and assured him that a second flag would be respected.</p><p></p><p>It was midnight before the governor finally received Jackson's terms: He must open Fort St. Michael and Fort Barancas to the Americans, who would hold them until enough Spanish troops arrived to protect their neutrality from the British. </p><p></p><p>Gonzalez Manrique consulted with his officers and rejected the proposal.</p><p></p><p>Before dawn, Jackson marched his men along a beach east of Pensacola, but sand made dragging their cannon impossible. After a brief skirmish, the terrified governor appeared with his own white flag and surrendered the town. The British remained in command of Fort Barancas six miles away.</p><p></p><p>Jackson planned his attack for the next morning. On his way to the fort, however, a deafening explosion told him that the British had blown up Barancas before abandoning it.</p><p></p><p>Although Jackson wrote a bitter note to the governor accusing him of bad faith, his progress so far left him buoyant. "The steady firmness of my troops has drew a just respect from our enemies," he wrote. "It has confirmed the Red Sticks that they have no stronghold or protections, only in the friendship of the United States."</p><p></p><p>Best of all, the good behavior of Jackson's Indian allies had impressed the Spanish residents of Pensacola. During their time ashore, Britain's troops had plundered the town and carried off most of its slaves. Jackson was gratified that the Spanish now believed "that our Choctaws are more civilized than the British."</p><p></p><p>All the same, Jackson had invaded a neutral territory. After he had already succeeded, he received Secretary Monroe's letter instructing him to do nothing to provoke a war with Spain. He could be certain, however, that Monroe was not unhappy with him. Jackson's exploit had further demoralized the hostile Indians, and newspapers back home were filled with extravagant praise.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>* * *</b></p><p></p><p>Jackson still suspected that the British might attack Mobile, but the pirate Jean Lafitte, a tall and elegant former blacksmith from Haiti, was telling the Americans otherwise. Lafitte had commandeered a port on Barataria Bay outside New Orleans as headquarters for his flotilla of outlaw ships. His men, called Baratarians, had struck lucrative alliances with the local businessmen for disposing of their contraband. Slaves who brought six hundred dollars or seven hundred dollars in legal trading could be purchased from smugglers for less than two hundred dollars.</p><p></p><p>Congress appreciated the damage being inflicted on British commerce by America's privateers, who had seized almost fourteen hundred British ships since the war began. Daring commanders were able to dart into a merchant fleet with their lightly armed ships and take over a British vessel before its guardian frigate could give chase. The American ship names reflected the spirit of their crews -- <i>True Blooded Yankee, Rattlesnake, Scourge, Catch Me If You Can.</i></p><p></p><p>In July 1812, Congress had taxed the privateers 2 percent of their bounty to provide for widows and orphans created by the war. Lately that levy had been lifted, but any legislation out of Washington hardly concerned Lafitte. He scoffed at neutrality laws and evaded all U.S. taxes, even though he considered himself an American patriot and claimed, "I have never ceased to be a good citizen."</p><p></p><p>Lafitte made good on that boast when the British invited him to regain respectability for himself and his gang by joining the Royal Navy. He would receive a naval commission and thirty thousand dollars; his men would be allotted sizeable tracts of the land the British intended to occupy.</p><p></p><p>In rejecting the offer, Lafitte turned over the British correspondence to Louisiana's governor Claiborne. He made the gesture in hopes of obtaining the release of eighty of his men, including his brother Pierre, who had been imprisoned after a recent government raid on their base.</p><p></p><p>With the letters he forwarded, Lafitte did not include his earlier draft in which he accepted Britain's offer. Given his change of heart, Lafitte wanted to impress on Claiborne that while America might see him as a criminal, he would never miss the chance to serve her.</p><p></p><p>Jackson also received copies of Britain's overtures. They underscored the urgent message he had received from Secretary Monroe that Admiral Cochrane was sailing in his direction with a formidable invasion force -- as many as fourteen thousand troops in at least sixty ships.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in New Orleans on December 1, Jackson understood why the British might feel confident. The local defenders were in disarray, with few ships on the water and only two small militia units for protection. Despite rumors of the impending danger, residents remained divided by politics and nationality into squabbling factions.</p><p></p><p>At the last census, New Orleans' total population had been less than twenty-five thousand. Most residents had been born into French-speaking families, and those of English heritage accounted for only one-eighth of the city. "Creole" had first been the name given to descendants of French settlers; now it also could apply to the Spanish and Portuguese. Cajuns, originally landing from Nova Scotia when the British drove them out in 1755, had settled along bayous that emptied into the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p></p><p>Despite their quarreling, all of the communities seemed to take heart from the general's arrival and were passing the word: "Jackson's come!"</p><p></p><p>The man they hailed as their savior had been weakened by his constant exertion and was near collapse. When Jackson had been rewarded with his commission in the U.S. Army, he shed his touchy preference for a volunteer militia, and his letter to Rachel had glowed with pride:</p><p></p><p>"You are now a Major Generals lady," he had written, and must appear "elegant and plain, not extravagant" in the style expected of her.</p><p></p><p>But urging his wife now to join him in New Orleans, Jackson was less concerned with her wardrobe than with the beds and bedsteads he wanted her to bring to his camp. He explained that before leaving Pensacola, he had been taken very ill. Purging him with two herbs -- jalap and calomel -- the doctors had helped to restore his health. But there had followed "eight days on the march that I never broke bread."</p><p></p><p>Although Jackson looked cadaverous and older than his forty-seven years, he willed himself to stand erect in his uniform of blue homespun, yellow buckskin, and scuffed boots, and to ride with his usual energy.</p><p></p><p>He set about blocking the mouths of the many bayous that extended into the city. Jackson posted a guard at each of them and brought forward five gunboats to Lake Borgne. They were to act as decoys and attempt to draw the British ships into range of the guns at Fort Petites Coquilles, a small base built on a channel of land connecting Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain.</p><p></p><p>Next, Jackson had to decide what use to make of Jean Lafitte. In the past, he had cursed the pirates as "hellish banditti." But he might need their skill and daring. As his go-between, Jackson could depend on his new aide-de-camp, Edward Livingston, a brother of the Robert Livingston who had negotiated the Louisiana Purchase. After a financial scandal forced Edward to resign as mayor of New York, he had moved south, married the sister of a prominent Creole, and embraced the unfettered life of the frontier. His law clients these days included pirates forced to appear in court, and when Livingston suggested that Jackson recruit them, his motive was not entirely civic-minded. The imprisoned pirates had promised him twenty thousand dollars if he could get them acquitted on charges of violating U.S. trade laws. Livingston had recommended that their best strategy would be to join the American army.</p><p></p><p>At first, Jackson refused to deal with the outlaws. When they finally met at Jackson's headquarters on Royal Street, however, Jean Lafitte argued compellingly in English -- he also spoke French, Spanish, and Italian -- that his men should be allowed to join in defending the city. Looking past Lafitte's courtly manners and expensive tailoring, Jackson recognized, as he had with William Weatherford, a kindred fighting spirit. A federal judge released the pirates from jail on the condition that they enlist, and Jackson sent Lafitte to run two batteries below New Orleans and assigned others from his crew to a company of marines.</p><p></p><p>Even before he arrived in New Orleans, Jackson had resolved the question of whether to recruit the town's six hundred free black men. In the past, many had fought for Spain, but Claiborne interviewed their leaders, including Major Pierre Lacoste, and satisfied himself that they were committed to America. The governor had written to Jackson in August and got back the general's exuberant approval.</p><p></p><p>"Our country has been invaded and threatened with destruction," Jackson wrote. "She wants soldiers to fight her battles. The free men of color in your city are inured to the Southern climate and would make excellent soldiers.

But it is a pair of strong-willed women who are Whip&#39;s most unexpected allies: the outspoken Cathy van Ayl, widowed and alone at twenty-four, and the beautiful half-Arapaho, half-Cherokee La-ena, who was once Whip&#39;s mistress. Before these brave pioneers lie endless miles of hardship and danger, treachery and death. Beneath their struggle for survival lie hidden rivalries, unspoken secrets, and burning jealousies that threaten to consume them all. But in their hearts beats the dream of a new beginning in a promised land - the unstoppable dream of America itself.</p><p>Dana Fuller Ross was the pseudonym of Noel Bertram Gerson.

From the Papers of W.

This extensive study of his own family ties to the Mayflower, and his exhaustive investigation of the first contacts between Europeans and Native Americans, in what is today New England, made him an unquestioned authority in both fields.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research upon which the text of Early Encounters is based occurred between the 1920s and the 1950s.

Material is arranged thematically: the arrival of the Mayflower; conflicts between Europeans and Native Americans; and other topics related to the history and legends of early European settlement on Cape Cod.

Chronic indiscipline, illegal drug use, and racial militancy all contributed to trouble within the ranks. But most chilling of all was the advent of a new phenomenon: large numbers of young enlisted men turning their weapons on their superiors. The practice was known as &#x201c;fragging,&#x201d; a reference to the fragmentation hand grenades often used in these assaults.<br> Between 1968 and 1973, dozens of Americans and Vietnamese were murdered in fragging incidents, but only a handful of their killers were ever brought to justice. Drawing upon more than 500 cases from official records in addition to interviews with both perpetrators and victims, George Lepre examines these episodes in close detail. A comparative analysis of fragging in American units and the Australian army in Vietnam is also included.<br> In the first in-depth study of this vexing trend, Lepre drills down to the core of the soldier&#x2019;s mindset, bringing to light a little understood aspect of military experience.</p><p>After several years in the U.S. Army, George Lepre is currently pursuing a graduate degree at the New School for Social Research.

That night nine U.S. Navy destroyers ran into Honda's fog-wrapped reefs. Part of Destroyer Squadron 11, the ships were making a fast run from San Francisco to their homeport of San Diego as fog closed around them. The captain of the flagship <i>Delphy</i> ordered a change of course, but due to navigational errors and unusual currents caused by an earthquake in Japan the previous week, she ran aground. Eight destroyers followed her. Only Pearl Harbor in 1941 would do more damage.<br><p>In dramatic hour-by-hour detail, the authors recreate what happened, including the heroic efforts to rescue men and ships. In addition to presenting a full picture of the tragedy, they cover the subsequent investigations, which became a media sensation. The authors suggest that the cause of the tragedy lay in the interpretation of the differences that exist between the classic concepts of naval regulations and the stark realism of the unwritten code of destroyer doctrine to follow the leader. Admiral Nimitz's introduction sets the scene for this action-filled account of America's greatest peacetime naval tragedy in history, first published in 1960.</p></p><p>Charles A.

This was an important signpost for the artist&#39;s oeuvre of recent times. The artist himself also contributes writings, including a sculptural text constructed like one of his sculptures.

It reveals the detailed and fully documented story, starting from 1948, of why the assertion that Israel has lived in constant danger of annihilation, the &#x201c;driving into the sea&#x201d; of its Jews, is Zionist propaganda nonsense. In the true story of what really happened after Israel unilaterally declared itself to be in existence, the Arab armies did not have the ability to defeat Israel&#x2019;s forces and, despite some stupid Arab rhetoric to the contrary which was a propaganda gift for Zionism, the Arab regimes had no intention of trying to destroy Israel. Here, too, is the riveting story of how Zionism, assisted by deluded British and French leaders and American hawks, conned the Western world into believing that Eygpt&#x2019;s President Nasser was as an enemy of the West when, actually, he was seeking an accommodation with Israel from almost his first days in power and wanted more than anything else a relationship with America on equal terms with Israel. Hart takes us inside President Eisenhower&#x2019;s struggle to contain Zionism, and President Kennedy&#x2019;s unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Zionist state acquiring an atom bomb (an acquisition still not admitted by either the US or Israel to this very day). Most importantly, Volume II records a turning point: the defeat of reason in Israel, and the despairing diary entry of Moshe Sharett (Israel&#x2019;s foreign minister and briefly prime minister who was opposed to almost everything Ben-Gurion represented): &#x201c;What is our vision on this earth&#x2014;war to the end of generations and life by the sword?&#x201d;</p><p>Alan Hart is a former BBC Panorama and ITN Middle East correspondent with a vast first-hand knowledge of the subject. He knew, and interviewed, many of the main players in the Israel-Palestine conflict on all sides (Golda Meir, Arafat and other PLO leaders, Dayan, Peres, Nasser, King Hussein of Jordan, Habash, King Feisal...). He also participated at a leadership level in the secret politics of the search for peace in the Middle East (as an intermediary between Carter and Peres when it was presumed Peres was headed for leadership). He is also author of Arafat: Terrorist or Peacemaker?In this extraordinary book, Alan Hart has succeeded in elucidating for us the immediate and long term dangers involved in the unconditional Western support for Zionism and its oppressive policies against the Palestinians. The author provides us with a chilling exposure of how this embrace developed and continues to endanger the Jewish existence and fuels the anti-Semitism that refuses to disappear. Motivated by a genuine concern for peace in Israel and Palestine and beyond in the world at large, Alan Hart has written not only a strong indictment of Zionism, based on both research and personal experience, but also provided us with a charter for a better future. --ILAN PAPPE Leading Israeli revisionist historican, author of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine<br><br>"I hope that all who are concerned about the troubles of the Middle East will read this book. It is immensely readable and a magnificent piece of work which reflects Alan Hart s close relationship with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. We are in terrible trouble in the Middle East. The book explains how we got here and how we could move forward. The tragedy is hurting Palestinians, Israelis and the rest of the world. All who wish to engage in finding a way forward will be helped by reading this book." --CLARE SHORT, MP-UK and International Development Secretary in Tony Blair's government until her resignation over Iraq<br><br>"Alan Hart's new books about Zionism and about the Israeli-Palestinian, Israeli- Arab, and now the Israeli-Muslim conflicts are, taken together, remarkably important and timely. His unique experiences and personal relationships make it possible for him to connect, and maybe even more notably to correct, the historical dots in a uniquely comprehensive way. Doing so as a seasoned journalist as well as a passionate advocate of true peace and real justice makes Hart's trilogy of books covering 1948 to the present nothing less than extraordinary. Taken together they represent a monumental accomplishment of epic proportions. If only responsible government officials around the world, especially in Washington, would read and ponder these books, take profound note of Hart's conclusions, and even at this very late date act before it is completely too late." --MARK BRUZONSKY MiddleEast.org, founder World Jewish Congress, first Washington Representative</p><h2>Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt.

Shaped-resist dyeing techniques have been done for centuries in every corner of the world. Yet more than half of the known techniques-in which cloth is in some way tied, clamped, folded, or held back during dyeing, to keep some areas from taking color - originated in Japan.<br><br>Shibori can be used not only to create patterns on cloth but to turn fabric from a two-dimensional into a three-dimensional object. The word is used here to refer to any process that leaves a "memory on cloth" -a permanent record, whether of patterning or texture, of the particular forms of resist done. In addition to traditional methods it encompasses high-tech processes like heat-set on polyester (made famous by Issey Miyake's revolutionary pleated clothing), melt-off on metallic fabric, the fulling and felting that make it possible to turn all-natural fabrics into three-dimensional shapes, weaving resist (in which, for instance, a warp thread can be pulled to gather the cloth to resist dye), and dï¿½vorï¿½e, in which just one part of a mixed fabric is dissolved with chemicals.<br><br>Author Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada has been teaching shibori around the world for nearly thirty years, and helped to establish the World Shibori Network and the International Shibori Symposium.

Nonetheless one has occurred with the long anticipated publication of <em>Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing</em>. Word of this book has long circulated in the inner and outer sanctums of the textile world with excitement and expectation building. This combination of bilingual, scholarly, creative and resourceful authors has brought us a classic volume . . . A masterful blend of historical material that puts Japanese textiles in context, clearly described and illustrated techniques along with information and illustrations of contemporary work from Japan and the West make this book an essential acquisition for anyone who proclaims a serious interest in textile dyeing, design, or historic textiles." ?Glen Kaufman, in <em>Surface Design Journal</em><br><br>"Well researched, well written, well organized and well illustrated." ?<em>Crafts Magazine</em></p><p>FOREWORD TO THE BOOK <p>Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada has chosen her subject well. As the global authority on shibori in its myriad forms Wada has, for decades, been the driving force behind this tradition's popularization. She is also spearhead of the International Shibori Symposium (ISS). Even so, this author is not fully appreciated, even by those who know her, even by the many in her debt for opening doors to art expression or commerce. Perhaps because of her diminutive frame, seeming reticence, and prolonged youth, we don't recognize a Colossus spanning East and West, past and future. </p><p>Decades ago, when the San Francisco Bay area was the absolute Vatican of fiber development in the Americas, Wada first served as a conduit to Asian resist-patterning traditions. As a founder of Kasuri Dyeworks and instructor at Fiberworks, Center for Textile Arts, she nurtured innovators such as Ed Rossbach and Katherine Westphal. Perhaps more than anyone else, Wada caused the evolution of fiber focus from cloth structure to the dye patterning that we now recognize as surface design. </p><p>Through her first book, Shibori, and through her exhibits, lectures, and personal persuasion in every communication medium, Wada has single-handedly changed our field and its language. For instance, the Malay/Indonesian term plangi, first proposed by Swiss scholars and widely used for almost a century, is now less often heard than the Wada term, shibori -- itself an umbrella for dozens of methods including fold-dye, stitch and clamp resists, and even a woven form. </p><p>Still more crucial at the dawn of the third millennium are shibori methods as the most dynamic of all textile aspects. While patterning with liquid resists (batik) or binding yarns to resist dyes (ikat) are by their nature limited, shibori resists embrace an extremely flexible universe. By providing both discipline and freedom in many mediums, shibori has the potential to transform post-industrial craftsmanship. </p><p>For example, any manner of pleats -- random or precise -- can be created through automation, then pad-dyed or transfer-printed, then opened -- all without human involvement! Whether crisply defined or shadowy, the resulting pattern is as full of miniscule accidents for natural randomness as traditional shibori. Because we can perceive this marriage of liquid dyes and thirsty cloth, this "understanding of making" is a pleasure increasingly rare in an industrialized world. That this organic patterning is also three-dimensional makes it the optimal antidote to the monotony of mass production. </p><p>More recently we learned that shibori can also be used to subtract color (discharge) or fiber (burn-out) or even whole layers of cloth. We have also learned that using shibori methods for permanently pleating or shrinking cloth creates miraculous surfaces. Finally unlocking the potential of thermoplastic memory, we are using these new wrinkles to resist wrinkles, increase comfort, and widen ranges of size and fit. </p><p>Fortunately, Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada understands all this full well. She also knows the designers opening up these universes. Crescendo! </p><p>Jack Lenor Larsen</p><br>For nearly thirty years, surface-design artist, curator, and textile researcher YOSHIKO IWAMOTO WADA has been teaching shibori, first in Berkeley, California and then around the world. Many who took her classes went on to become artists and teachers themselves, and thanks to Wada's efforts the field has expanded geometrically over the course of a single generation. In 1983 she also coauthored, with Mary Kellogg Rice and Jane Barton, the definitive book in English, <em>Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped-Resist Dyeing</em>. As Jack Lenor Larsen puts it in his foreword to <em>Memory on Cloth</em>, "Through her first book, Shibori, and through her exhibits, lectures, and personal persuasion in every communication medium, Wada has single-handedly changed our field and its language." Because of her commitment to keeping shibori traditions alive, the word "shibori" has now become universally accepted as the term for shaped-resist processes. Wada continues to travel the world searching for shibori innovations and outstanding artists.<br></p><h2>Hors D'Oeuvres &amp; Appetizers (Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Library)</h2><p>Introduces useful equipment and techniques for making appetizers, and shares recipes featuring cheese, eggs, vegetables, fish, shellfish, poultry, and meat</p><p>This elegantly photographed volume is edited by cookware-emporium and catalogue czar Williams, of Williams-Sonoma fame, with recipes by sisters Marianne Comolli, Elisabeth Scotto and Michele Carles ( France the Beautiful Cookbook ). They have exercised obvious restraint in keeping the recipes from becoming too equipment-dependent, though a nicely photographed spread of cookware and appliances tastefully promotes Williams-Sonoma products. Many of the recipes are quite formal, from a terrine of Mediterranean mixed vegetables to new potatoes with tapenade to fish tartare, though more casual offerings also put in an appearance--mini pizzas with spicy meat topping and sesame shrimp. The book is apparently meant to be marketed to the international English-speaking community; the recipes include both U.S.- and U.K.-standard measurements and accommodate national language differences, such as by parenthetically placing ``aubergines'' next to eggplants and ``courgettes'' next to zucchini. Yet while catering to the international market makes good business sense, this format can be confusing--especially when certain items seem to fall through the cracks of precise translation. For example, the recipe for mini pizzas with mozzarella doesn't specify what type of black olives to use (though the accompanying photography suggests the pungent kalamata or nicoise versus the common, canned California black), and the blue cheese tartlets recipe calls for ``the robust flavor'' of spinach or Swiss chard (both mildly flavored greens) to balance ``the tang of blue cheese.'' <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Great Gardens of London: 30 Masterpieces from Private Plots to Palaces</h2><p><p><b>NEW EDITION.</b><br><br> London&#x2019;s gardeners are twice blessed: not only do they live in one of the world&#x2019;s most vibrant capitals, it is also one of the most verdant.

Tormented by her own puzzled heart, Kate seeks solace and wise counsel from both old friends and new. But who precisely is the enemy? Is he or she a vengeful colleague? A hostile student? A terrorist sect? The questions mount as Kate searches for Reed--accompanied by her trusty new companion, a Saint Bernard puppy named Bancroft. Hovering near Kate and Bancroft are rampant cruelties and calculated menace. The moment is ripe for murder. . . .</p><p>Feminist scholar (and senior citizen) Carolyn Heilbrun has been writing and lecturing for years about the unique freedom women gain from being old and thus "invisible" in our culture. Writing under the name of Amanda Cross, she continues to explore this theme in another of her popular academic mysteries featuring feminist professor Kate Fansler. In <i>The Puzzled Heart</i>, Fansler's husband, Reed, has been kidnapped, and the ransom demand requires Kate to give up her left-leaning politics and join the Christian Right. Instead, Kate turns to septuagenarian detective Harriet Furst, a woman whose advanced age allows her to "move about the world unseen" as she gathers clues. It doesn't take long for Harriet to find Reed, but discovering who was behind the kidnapping proves more difficult. In the course of exposing the culprit, Cross entertains her audience with the kind of highly literate, witty writing and outspoken politics that have been hallmarks of Kate Fansler mysteries for the past 30 years.When I read THE JAMES JOYCE MURDER, I instantly became a fan of Amanda Cross and her protagonist, English professor Kate Fansler. And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda." And another cherished memory I have of this charming, gracious, and multitalented author.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher</p><h2>American Raiders: The Race to Capture the Luftwaffe s Secrets</h2><p><p>At the close of World War II, Allied forces faced frightening new German secret weapons--buzz bombs, V-2's, and the first jet fighters. When Hitler's war machine began to collapse, the race was on to snatch these secrets before the Soviet Red Army found them.</p><p>The last battle of World War II, then, was not for military victory but for the technology of the Third Reich. In <i>American Raiders: The Race to Capture the Luftwaffe's Secrets</i>, Wolfgang W. E. Samuel assembles from official Air Force records and survivors' interviews the largely untold stories of the disarmament of the once mighty Luftwaffe and of Operation Lusty--the hunt for Nazi technologies.</p><p>In April 1945 American armies were on the brink of winning their greatest military victory, yet America's technological backwardness was shocking when measured against that of the retreating enemy. Senior officers, including the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, knew all too well the seemingly overwhelming victory was less than it appeared. There was just too much luck involved in its outcome.</p><p>Two intrepid American Army Air Forces colonels set out to regain America's technological edge. One, Harold E. Watson, went after the German jets; the other, Donald L. Putt, went after the Nazis' intellectual capital--their world-class scientists.</p><p>With the help of German and American pilots, Watson brought the jets to America; Putt persevered as well and succeeded in bringing the German scientists to the Army Air Forces' aircraft test and evaluation center at Wright Field. A young P-38 fighter pilot, Lloyd Wenzel, a Texan of German descent, then turned these enemy aliens into productive American citizens--men who built the rockets that took America to the moon, conquered the sound barrier, and laid the foundation for America's civil and military aviation of the future.</p><p><i>American Raiders: The Race to Capture the Luftwaffe's Secrets</i> details the contest won, a triumph that shaped America's victories in the Cold War.</p></p><p>A riveting account of the American servicemen who scrambled to keep Hitler&#x2019;s technology out of Soviet handsA riveting account of the American servicemen who scrambled to keep Hitler&#39;s technology out of Soviet&#39;s hands|A riveting account of the American servicemen who scrambled to keep Hitler&#39;s technology out of Soviet hands</p><h2>The Philosophy of Silver Birch</h2><p>extracted by former secretary to Maurice Barbanel from Silver Birch Teachings covers issues such as natural laws,lessons of bereavement, responsibility of mediumship</p><p></p><h2>H.C. Westermann</h2><p>The irony and antic sense of humor that animate the work of H. C. Westermann (1922&#x2013;1981) and make it so accessible are evident on every page of this volume, the first comprehensive study of <br>the artist in over 20 years. Published to accompany a major traveling exhibition of Westermann&#x2019;s <br>sculpture, the book looks at how defining themes central to 20th-century America&#x2014;the horror and disillusionment of war, the mythology of the American utopia, and Hollywood and mass media&#x2014;shaped his thought and his art. <p>Magnificent color illustrations accompany essays by Robert Storr, who evaluates Westermann in the context of 20th-century art; Lynne Warren, who looks at his years in Chicago in the 1950s; Dennis Adrian, a longtime friend, who surveys the artist&#x2019;s entire oeuvre; and Michael Rooks, who examines his most elaborate achievement, the house and studio in Connecticut that the artist designed and built by hand from 1969 to 1981.</p></p><p>H.C. Westermann's sculptures and constructions follow no models and are unique in modern American art. Direct, simple objects that achieve great sophistication and subtlety, they make profound comments on society and the human condition without being overtly burdened by theory. Westermann grew up in L.A., "great city of the vernacular," where Hollywood films had a larger impact on him than fine arts. One of the authors describes him as an "American everyman." Idiosyncratic, a loner in his work though not his personal life, he trained in Chicago, then settled in rural Connecticut rather than self-conscious New York (where in 1959 his first show was deflated by the critics). Besides being the catalog of an exhibition of Westermann's work organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, <i>H.C. Westermann</i> is the best monograph on the artist to date. Four lively essays describe his career and analyze his work. One of his defining experiences, witnessing the loss of a ship with 2,000 lives as a marine in WWII, resulted in a series of sculptures that he titled <i>Death Ships</i>, meticulously conceived in a variety of materials, from dollar bills to ebony. He exorcized his demons and was a fine friend, neighbor, and husband. Happily married and a consummate craftsman, he came to "equate the strength and beauty of a dovetail joint with the foundation of a good home and a good life." The integrity of the man and significance of his work are well served by this attractively produced study. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Dennis Adrian is an art critic, historian, and independent curator living in Chicago.

The Assyrians were widely feared and hated during the period of their ascendancy (approximately 1000 to 600 B.C.E.). The author does not shy away from describing the cruelty of their warfare, which included mass executions of civilians and deportations. He also describes the techniques of siege warfare perfected by the Assyrians. This is a complete and well-rounded study and includes the less martial accomplishments of the culture as well: the building of a great library and well-ordered cities. Nardo also does an admirable job of dealing with the complex reasons behind the decline of the Roman Empire. He describes the factors such as economic instability, political divisiveness, and, most tellingly, military defeats and barbarian invasions that eventually tolled a death knell for one of history's longest-lived empires. Also included is information about the lasting heritage that Rome bequeathed to Western civilization, including the Christian faith, laws, and culture that we still carry with us today. Excellent, up-to-date bibliographies and numerous black-and-white photos and drawings make these books worthwhile purchases for research purposes.<br><i>David N.

So begins this wide-ranging narrative by an award-winning political commentator, which is the first major study of the Cold War. Now that it is over, it is crucial to our future to understand how the Cold War has shaped us and, especially, to recognize it as the economic and political dynamic that determined the structure of today&#39;s global economy. From the origins of the Marshall Plan, which revived Europe after World War II, and the strategic decision to rebuild a defeated Japan into a bulwark against China to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, this authoritative work reveals how the West was built into an economic alliance that overpowered the Soviet economy while also unleashing global economic forces that today challenge the traditional nation-state. The Cold War was more of a global conflict than was either of this century&#39;s two major wars; far more than a confrontation between states or even empires, it was, as Martin Walker puts it, &#34;a total war between economic and social systems, an industrial test to destruction&#34;. Walker reminds us how easy it is to forget that there were many occasions from the late 1940s on when victory seemed far from assured, and that lent a particular urgency to the efforts of postwar Western leaders. The West continued to be alarmed by the prospect of defeat right up to the Soviet empire&#39;s last breath. At the end of the 1940s the fear was generated by communist expansion into Eastern Europe and China; in the 1950s it was fueled by the Soviets&#39; supposed technological superiority, and in the 1960s by the prospect of defeat in Vietnam. In the 1970s the failure of detente and theWest&#39;s economic crisis brought a new generation of dedicated anti-Communists to prominence. For more than forty years, as this detailed analysis makes clear, the outcome of the Cold War was in doubt. We also come to understand how the arms race caused new alignments and shifts in domestic power. As the United States became the national security state, California, which had a population of five million at the start of the Cold War, grew to thirty million and, by the 1980s, provided one in every ten members of Congress and two presidents. Using newly opened Kremlin archives and his own experiences in the field, the author has written, with style and authority, a brilliant analysis of the conflict that has shaped the contemporary world.<b>Martin Walker</b>, author of <i>The Cold War: A History </i>and the Bruno, Chief of Police mystery series, is the U.S. bureau chief for <i>The Guardian</i> (London), a regular commentator for CNN, and a columnist for newspapers in the United States, Europe, and Moscow.

But no such group existed, and I turned toward Wicca.

The reader is tossed slam-bang into a mostly Russian-born family of socialist workers and confirmed Marxists, forced by pogroms to flee to America's lower East Side, where their political divisiveness continues. Although we follow with interest the fortunes of various inlawsamong them the Berliners, wealthy German-Jewish owners of a department storethe focus is on Hannah and Moyshe Levy and their daughter Sarah, who has married Marxist apologist Avi Spector. The ideological rift between the Levys and the Spectors widens when, at the onset of the Depression, Moyshe sides with the Bundists while Avi supports the Stalinists. As Sarah campaigns for unions and women's right to decent pay, her sister Ruby, married to Ben Berliner, becomes a force in the fashion industry. Woven into the fabric of domestic activism is the dream of a Jewish state in Palestine. At the same time, polemical art, modeled on Guernica and the Diego Rivera murals, begins to blossom and to provide an outlet for the fiercely suppressed memories of murder in the Pale.

For the two years leading up to his murder, Ivers had hosted the underground but increasingly popular LA-based music and sketch-comedy cable show <i>New Wave Theatre</i>. <br> <br> The late '70s through early '80s was an explosive time for pop culture: <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and <i>National Lampoon</i> were leading a comedy renaissance, while punk rock and new wave were turning the music world on its head. New Wave Theatre brought together for the first time comedians-turned-Hollywood players like John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Harold Ramis with West Coast punk rockers Black Flag, the Dead Kennedys, Fear, and others, thus transforming music and comedy forever. The show was a jubilant, chaotic punk-experimental-comedy cabaret, and Ivers was its charismatic leader and muse. He was, in fact, the only person with the vision, the generosity of spirit, and the myriad of talented friends to bring together these two very different but equally influential worlds, and with his death the improbable and electric union of punk and comedy came to an end. <br> <br> The magnetic, impishly brilliant Ivers was a respected musician and composer (in addition to several albums, he wrote the music for the centerpiece song of David Lynch's cult classic <i>Eraserhead</i>) whose sublime and bizarre creativity was evident in everything he did. He was surrounded by people who loved him, many of them luminaries: his best friend from his Harvard days was Doug Kenney, founder of <i>National Lampoon</i>; he was also close to Harold Ramis and John Belushi. Upon his death, Ivers was just beginning to get mainstream recognition. <br> <br> <i>In Heaven Everything Is Fine</i> is the first book to explore both the fertile, gritty scene that began and ended with <i>New Wave Theatre</i> and the life and death of its guiding spirit. Josh Frank, author of <i>Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies</i>, interviewed hundreds of people from Ivers's circle, including Jello Biafra, Stockard Channing, and David Lynch, and we hear in their own words about Ivers and the marvelous world he inhabited. He also spoke with the Los Angeles Police Department about Ivers's still-unsolved murder, and, as a result of his research, the Cold Case Unit has reopened the investigation. <i>In Heaven Everything Is Fine</i> is a riveting account of a gifted artist, his tragic death, and a little-known yet crucial chapter in American pop history.</p><p><b>Josh Frank</b> is the author (with Caryn Ganz) of <i>Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies</i> and a screenwriter, composer, and director.<br><br><b>Charlie Buckholtz</b>, a freelance writer, received an MFA from Syracuse University and is currently working on his first novel.Ï»ï¿½<p> chapter 1 </p><p> <b>I March Forth!</b><b> </b></p><p><b> Brookline, Massachusetts, 1956, 4:15 p.m.</b> </p><p> Merle Ivers finished up some household chores and turned to her real work of the day. Peter would be home from school soon; what music should she play for him today? She flipped through her record collection. A classical symphony, a selection of jazz standards, a Broadway show? Peter seemed to love them all as much as she did -- and to appreciate them with an almost uncanny level of sophistication. In addition to music, his interests at this age included soccer and an intense preoccupation with the intricacies and nuances of human relationships. He was a small boy, but naturally active and athletic, charismatic and always well liked. And he liked the girls. It didn't hurt that he had a devastating set of what Merle had always thought of as "bedroom eyes." </p><p> Merle was open and encouraging of Peter and her daughter Ricki's interests and quirky turns of mind. She was also disciplined, at times strict, about ensuring that their minds and bodies were consistently stimulated, challenged, and engaged. She believed that children needed structure, but not because she was invested in either of her children conforming to societal norms. In a way, it was just the opposite: from her love of music she knew that structure provided the possibility for creative exploration. She felt that the right musical education would enable her children to learn this, and so she put great care into planning Peter's musical diet, carefully selecting just the right record to feed his mind and soul on any given day. </p><p> It was this core set of values, and her close relationships with her children, that had brought Merle's young family relatively unscathed through a set of very difficult years. Her first husband, Jordan Rose, was a doctor who had developed a rare cancer two years after Peter was born. They'd lived in Chicago until 1948, when the disease attacked his lungs and forced the family to relocate to Arizona, where his lungs could benefit from the clean dry air. He died a year later, a few months after Ricki's birth. </p><p> <i>Ah</i>, Guys and Dolls, Merle thought, sliding the show tune from the stack. <i>Perfect</i>. She held it, reconsidered, and returned it to its sleeve. <i>Maybe today is a better day for jazz.</i> </p><p> A widow at twenty-six with two young children in tow, Merle moved back in with her parents in Chicago. But she was an optimist, and she disciplined herself against despair. Only a few months after Jordan's death, she took a trip to Florida, where she met thirty-one-year-old Paul Isenstein, a former Bostonian who had retired to the bachelor's life after some early success in the textile business. Though perhaps not jazz's biggest fan -- he played the reserved, conservative straight man to Merle's free spirit -- Isenstein was a good man. And, most important, he was instantly and fervently <i>Merle's</i> biggest fan. Paul wanted to marry her immediately. And after getting to know him better, she was crazy for him, too. (The only thing she was not crazy for was his last name, which she found too provincial. She picked "Ivers" out of a phone book, and Paul, in his zealotry to win her over, took it on as his own.) </p><p> <i>Nineteen-Â­fifty -- a good year for jazz</i>, Merle thought, flipping through her records. She still had not decided what to play for Peter today. </p><p> Merle and the kids moved to Paul's apartment in Brookline, a suburb of Boston. A few years after they married, he set up his own successful business and soon moved the family into a proper house. Like his new wife, the children's education was always Paul's topmost concern. </p><p> Merle could not have been happier. Within this bubble of upper-middle-class safety and comfort, her maternal instincts took flight. She sent eight-year-old Peter and six-year-old Ricki to sleepaway camp in Maine. When Peter lost interest in recreational camping, Merle insisted he find another productive use of his time. He chose a lab-science camp. Later, when he tired of that, Merle insisted he find a job. That summer, at age fourteen, he worked at the zoo. </p><p> Paul Ivers, though by nature less demonstrative than Merle and by necessity less involved in the day-to-day parenting, was nonetheless a loving, attentive, and above all dependable father throughout Peter and Ricki's childhood years. No matter what professional responsibilities vied for his attention, he could be counted on to appear in the cheering section of any soccer game or school play. </p><p> <i>Or</i>, Merle mused, <i>maybe today is a classical day? Mendelssohn or Mozart? Symphony or sonata?</i> </p><p> Usually, choosing Peter's music was an almost meditative time for Merle. But today her mind was not totally at ease. A few weeks ago his fifth-grade teacher had called her in for a private conference. Swearing Merle to secrecy, the teacher pleaded with her to take Peter out of the public school system. If her advice were discovered it could mean losing her job, but she felt it would be the best thing Merle could ever do for her son. "There is no way I'm going to be able to keep him focused," she had said, "there is just not enough here to satisfy his thirst for knowledge." </p><p> Roxbury Latin was the oldest continuously running preparatory school in the country, and one of the most prestigious. The teacher felt certain that it was the only kind of environment in which Peter could truly flourish. Its entrance standards were extremely competitive, and for the last several years Harvard University had been administering aptitude tests that played a key role in the admissions process. Merle had brought both Ricki and Peter in for the test, and the results were supposed to arrive in the mail any day. Merle could frankly care less about the test per se, the status and prestige. She just wanted to provide the optimal educational environment for her kids, and she felt confident that she could get them into a good school irrespective of the results of one test. </p><p> Paul, on the other hand, saw performance on a test like this as a barometer for all future performance in life. A good score would reflect that Peter had what it took, for example, to inherit the business Paul had grown from nothing, manage it effectively, make it flourish, and provide for his family even better than Paul had been able to provide for his. Though Merle knew Paul's heart was in the right place, his anxiety over the impending test results had recently brought an edge of tension into their home. </p><p> <i>Ah, yes</i>, Merle thought. <i>This is the one. Here we go</i>. She drew the day's album gently out of its sleeve and blew on it lightly, clearing the dust. She fixed it in place on the player, set the needle down gently, and waited for the opening chords. </p><p> Moments later she heard Peter's footsteps tracking up the walk, through the door. When he entered the room all her worries evaporated, like ghosts exposed to daylight. His little face was so open yet so certain. Eyes voraciously curious, yet seeming to hold some profound hidden understanding. One look at him and she knew everything would be fine. </p><p> Then she realized that Peter himself did not seem totally fine, his mind appeared to be chewing on some concerns of its own. He didn't wait for her to ask what was wrong. He was worried, he told her, because he'd heard that the atomic bomb was coming and they were all going to be killed. </p><p> Merle wanted to reassure him but did not want to say something false or pat. It went against her nature and everything she believed about being a good parent. (The first and only time she had ever spanked Ricki was when, at age three, she told a lie. Peter had stood outside the house in protest, wailing, far more upset than Ricki herself.) But more important, he would see right through it. At ten, Peter had an unnervingly sharp eye for discerning falseness and authenticity. Platitudes would do nothing to calm him, but she had an idea of what would. </p><p> "Peter," Merle said. "What are you worried about? If the atomic bomb comes, we're all going to go. You won't be alone. If you go, I'm going, too. We'll all be together." </p><p> Peter focused his eyes and nodded slowly.

She lives with her family in New Jersey. </p>Louise is a pigtailed, pint-size alligator with new gleaming-white baby choppers&#x2014;which, unfortunately, give her a tendency to... how to put it? Gnaw. On everything. Everyone. Everywhere. (A bite-size hole on the jacket suggests that it, too, has succumbed to Louise's insatiable maw.) In wryly well-bred cadences that are a hoot to read aloud, Palatini (<i>Piggie Pie</i>) goes on to chronicle how Louise's biting manages to drive everyone around her to the brink, including an entire beach full of day trippers (Louise was sorry. She was really, really, truly quite sorry). Reinhart (the Encyclopedia Prehistorica pop-ups) gleefully records the mayhem with nicely nutty watercolor-and-ink cartoons that take full advantage of Louise's propensity to go for the gluteus maximus. The story looks like it's headed down an overly familiar lane when Grandmama Sadie positions herself as the only gator who truly understands Louise (This is only a phase my little joy is going through, she avers, chucking Louise under her scaly chin). But instead of the expected heart-to-heart, Louise takes a chomp out of Grandmama too. Lots of fun&#x2014;and certain to be the object of repeat-reading demands.

Working with an international team of historians, the renowned nonfiction publisher Dorling Kindersley used their extensive image library to create a visual chronology of world history, laden with photographs of real artifacts, tools, and art from around the globe, as well as illustrations and photographs of the people who lived in each era.<p> Summarizing the entire history of civilization seems a daunting task, but the organizational work here is exemplary. Each chapter covers a historical period from several centuries in the earliest times to a 25-year span in recent times. Beginning with a world map, each chapter offers a time line and a double-page spread identifying the major events and developments within five geographic areas: Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. More specific discussions for these geographic areas follow, along with additional illustrations, maps, and small, specific time lines. Because of the organizational scheme using five world divisions, all areas of the world receive equal treatment. An additional 115-page reference section includes a glossary of terms and a comprehensive index. <i>The Dorling Kindersley History of the World</i> is a welcome addition to the family reference shelf for students from fourth grade through high school. <i>(Ages 9 and older)</i></p>The latest endeavor of Dorling Kindersley, the publisher who introduced the popular and much-copied <i>Eyewitness </i>series, is this beautifully illustrated history for young readers. This ambitious volume begins 570 million years ago and ends with the 1990s. It is divided into sections of varying increments and includes such major events as wars, political upheavals, and inventions. For example, the section "1000-1200: Monks and Invaders" begins with a world map noting important events during this 200-year period. A table lists important events on all five continents. An asterisk on the table notes that more detailed information on this event follows. A time line running across the bottom of each page is highlighted to show the time period being covered.<p>Dealing as it does with the entire history of the planet, it stands to reason that each era could not be dealt with at length. However, the stunning photography and art here is enough to pique readers' interest on a variety of topics and hopefully will inspire them to do more reading elsewhere. A final reference section includes a glossary and an index.</p><p>This beautifully planned book is an excellent tool for stirring interest in history. There is only one area that could be improved upon: there is no pronunciation key of any type. The format and visuals will attract a wide range of reading abilities (upper primary to middle grades), and children will have no idea how to pronounce such names as <i>Cleisthenes</i> or <i>Menes</i>. Phonetic spelling following the more difficult terms and names would have been helpful. <i></i></p></p><h2>Old Norse Made New: Essays on the Post-Medieval Reception of Old Norse Literature and Culture</h2><p>These eight essays investigate the reinvention of Old Norse-Icelandic literature and culture by writers in English from the eighteenth century to the present day, from Thomas Gray to Tolkien and beyond.</p><p></p><h2>McDuff Comes Home (new design)</h2><p>McDuff, a little terrier, leaves Fred and Lucy&#39;s garden to chase a rabbit and finds himself lost, but with the help of a kind lady, he is returned once again to his loving family.</p><p>Ages 3-5. The white terrier who found a home with Fred and Lucy in <i>McDuff Moves In</i> gets lost again when he sees a rabbit in the neighbor's yard and chases him "over hills and streets and flower beds" and into Mrs. Higgins' garden. The matronly Mrs. Higgins puts him in the sidecar of her red motorcycle and is driving him into town, when McDuff recognizes the smells, the sounds, and the sight of home. All four characters enjoy a splendid picnic together. Like the first book, this one features a 1930s period setting, an appealing little dog, and a consistent and believable portrayal of the canine point of view. The double-page spreads showing multiple images, such as the one in which McDuff chases the rabbit, raises questions of whether young children will understand that this is one pair of animals shown many times, rather than many dogs and rabbits chasing one another. Still, the bold shapes and colors of the artwork are one of the book's main drawing points. A mildly quirky picture book, just right for little dog lovers. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>PreS. McDuff, an all-too-curious Yorkshire terrier, finds himself far from home when a rabbit in the next yard proves to be too much temptation and he takes off after it. The rabbit outwits him, though, and the small dog suddenly realizes that he's lost. Help comes in the form of a lively senior citizen who finds the wayward pup and takes him home (with directions from McDuff) on her motorcycle. Wells is a master at the delicate art of story, and Jeffers's realistic illustrations are wonderfully enticing. They successfully depict the curiosity that got McDuff into trouble in the first place, the penitent look when the elderly woman finds him, and the excitement of reunion. Children will revel in this second story about this endearing pup.?Christy Norris, Valley Cottage Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Two Kinds Of Faith</h2><p>This book shows you,scripturally, what real faith is. It breaks down the difference between hope and faith.It helps one to see that Gods Word is reality no matter what we may "think" or "feel" in the natural while still being "realistic." This book is a must read for anybody wanting a "deeper" walk with God. Read it expecting the Holy Spirit to reveal truths to you that are easily applicable to any life situation getting you results because of the truth of Gods Word<br><br>Unanswered prayers stand between the individual and a faith life. Some have lost faith altogether. Many have turned to philosophical and metaphysical cults because their prayer lives were failures. There is but one foundation for Faith, the Living Word. As we become one with the Word in our actions, then faith becomes an unconscious reality. you never think of your faith, you only think of the need and His ability to meet it. This book shows you the difference between real faith, mental assent and hope. Hope is always in the future... you never receive what you are hoping for. FAITH IS NOW! Real faith is acting on the Word, independent of any Sense Evidence. This book will explain and show you the difference between real faith and Sense Knowledge faith. Sense Knowledge faith has almost driven real faith out of the churches. "Believing" is really "acting on the Word", and Faith is the result of action.</p><p>Dr. E. W.

Our occupations take so much of our time and energy. Are our lives out of balance? <p> As followers of Jesus, how involved in business should we be?

All the while they are experiencing tremendously challenging symptoms that impact dramatically on their enjoyment of life and are being subjected to unnecessary procedures and diagnostics. The symptoms typically include bloating, constipation, functional diarrhea, chronic abdominal pain and functional dyspepsia (FD, the medical term for a condition that causes an upset stomach or pain or discomfort in the upper belly, near the ribs). </p><p> This comprehensive book provides current and concise information and understanding on the condition of IBS and FD. Dr. Alvin Newman discusses the symptoms in a thorough yet approachable manner, including the impact of these symptoms, diagnostic tools, diseases, conditions and complications associated with both conditions. Equally vital is integral information on managing both IBS and FD through lifestyle changes, drug therapy and dietary therapy. There is also extensive information on current IBS research and self-help for patients in the form of support groups and reliable internet sources. </p><p> Diagnosis can be difficult because of the range, severity and diversity of ailments, and prescribing successful treatments is no less difficult.

I suppose it&#x2019;s so anyone who slept in it was reminded right away whose house they were waking up in. I couldn&#x2019;t forget, not really, even without its angry, flaring nostrils and silver-flecked wings.<br> &nbsp;<br> Me and the bed both belonged to the King of Orstral. Winter had begun its cold creep into the north. The moun-tains I could see from the window of my chamber, blue and purple in the haze, had caps of white on their heads. The first frosts had long since drawn their crystal fingers across my window pane, and the smell of pine was everywhere in the palace as it busied itself to prepare for Yule.<br> &nbsp;<br> Back at the orchard, Mama was stirring the suet for the pud-ding, every day adding a splash more of the dark rum she bought just for the season. When we were small, me, Ether, and Jon would fuss over who got to stir each morning before breakfast. Each turn of the spoon came with a wish&#x2014;usually for a foolish thing or trinket that would sometimes appear on Long Night. I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking what Mama and Ether might wish for this year as they stood, spoon in hand, in an unusually quiet kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> I gave the winged bull a hard look from my pillow as I ran my fingers over the smooth willowbark of a figurine with a cheer-fully burning acorn in the cage of its belly. I&#x2019;d been careful to hide the gift Lark&#x2019;d given me back in Presston when we were first acquainted&#x2014;in the sturdy nameday box made for me by Papa. But some nights, the only way to quiet my noisy head was to take the Jack from its den beneath my Allcloth and let the glamour lull me to sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> A tap at the door let me know my lying-about-and-feeling-sorry-for-myself time had come to an end. The hinges creaked and the familiar figure of my friend Lark slipped in&#x2014;a dark silhouette in front of the bright window.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tides,&#x201d; she gasped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s colder&#x2019;n a toad&#x2019;s belly in here! You forgot to close the drapes last night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t forget,&#x201d; I mumbled as she scuttled toward the hearth to make up the fire. &#x201c;I just wanted to look at the stars.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She clucked her tongue. &#x201c;Stars&#x2019;ll still be there in summer, y&#x2019;know. No need to turn your chamber into an icehouse!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sat up, hugging my knees under the quilt. &#x201c;I was trying to pretend I was looking out my own window. It keeps the bad dreams away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark poked at the smoldering logs with the fire iron. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t remember the last time I had a good dream.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Shame pricked at my heart. I may have belonged to the king, but at least I enjoyed a measure of comfort. Instead of making merry with the rest of the Ordish clans at the Southmeet in Farrier&#x2019;s Bay, Lark was trapped in Bellskeep&#x2014;a servant, even less her own master than I was. My servant, indentured to the king until her father could raise the coin to buy her and her brother, Rowan, back.<br> &nbsp;<br> I patted the down mattress. &#x201c;Come warm up while we&#x2019;re waiting for the fire to do its work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She looked toward the door warily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, no one&#x2019;s gonna bust in. If anyone complains that I&#x2019;m tardy, I&#x2019;ll just tell &#x2019;em I was being a slugabed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark didn&#x2019;t need more persuading. She climbed up to join me beneath the quilt, taking care not to crease the fine indigo silk dress she&#x2019;d been given to accompany me on important occasions like the one that morning. She laid her head on the pillow with a sigh of relief.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The hearth in the indentures&#x2019; hall burns all night, but it&#x2019;s still not much warmer than out-of-doors since the season changed.&#x201d; She raised her hands to her lips to blow some feeling back into them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mother&#x2019;s teeth!&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;What happened to your fingers?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She turned them over to look at them, wincing at her ragged red nail cases. &#x201c;The fabric bunched funny on one of Lady Monkford&#x2019;s gowns and I got the hem crooked. Her ladyship complained to the seamstress, so I spent last evening in the laundry. The lye Mistress Gibb uses is wicked strong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I took her hands in mine, all cold and cracked, thinking of how warm they&#x2019;d been in the summer when she&#x2019;d first led me aboard her barge, the Briar.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A few nights ago, I did dream Papa came to get us,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;The River was a real river, and all the barges sailed under the bridges and right to the palace. It was good, but I was so sorry to wake up, I&#x2019;d rather not have dreamed it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d held my peace long enough. I hadn&#x2019;t spoken of it before&#x2014;not to Lark or anyone&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t bear the sorrow in her eyes anymore.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not gonna be a dream much longer, Lark.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What d&#x2019;you mean?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I made a bargain. I hope it&#x2019;ll have us both home before the snowdrops bloom.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark sat up like a shot, looking more alarmed than pleased. &#x201c;What sort of bargain?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shushed her. &#x201c;One the whole palace don&#x2019;t need to know about, so keep your voice down!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only, there ain&#x2019;t a soul here you should be making bargains with!&#x201d; she whispered furiously. &#x201c;Not for you, and certainly not for me and Ro! You can&#x2019;t trust no one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I got dragged here so the king would know who to trust, in case you forgot!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the very reason I wasn&#x2019;t stirring the pudding bowl in Mama&#x2019;s kitchen. All because I could see lies. No one could tell one&#x2014;not about a plot to topple the kingdom or what they had for lunch&#x2014;without me knowing. Non once compared a lie to a wall the truth had to find a way round. And while I couldn&#x2019;t exactly see the truth, I could at least see the cracks in the wall where it was leaking out. A vivid wreath of color rounded the liar, intangible as will-o&#x2019;-the-wisp, but revealing all manner of shame and fear, kindness and ill intentions. The Ordish, who knew more about augury than most folk, called it a cunning. I called it a curse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Course I didn&#x2019;t forget,&#x201d; insisted Lark, slipping out from under the quilt and heading to my wardrobe. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there&#x2019;s things we don&#x2019;t know yet! Like who the fella from the Southmeet was&#x2014;the one with the port-wine stain who got Jon&#x2019;s lot to attack your carriage. Or who&#x2019;s burning the grain stores!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I frowned. Two days before, the news had come of another grain store out by Clifflight Watch going up in flames. Folk were blaming the Ordish, but my brother, whose life was now inter-twined with the people of the river, told me there wasn&#x2019;t a man, woman, or child among them who&#x2019;d do anything so wickedly wasteful.<br> &nbsp;<br> And even worse, hunger was starting to pinch bellies from north to south. Less grain meant less flour. Less flour meant less bread, and less bread meant folk had to part with more coin to buy it. If it was meant to turn Orstral further against the Ordish, it was working.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . ooh, cold!&#x201d; I yelped as my bare feet touched the stone floor. I danced on tiptoe over to the rug in front of the hearth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying I trust her in particular, but I&#x2019;d know if she was trying to play me false.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Ordish girl looked at me suspiciously as she laid my morning clothes on the bed. &#x201c;She who? The princess?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not her,&#x201d; I whispered, motioning Lark closer. &#x201c;Lady Folque.&#x201d; The dish of gold hairpins she was holding dropped to the floor with a clang, sending its contents skittering across the floor like bright minnows in a creek.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have you got river mud for brains?&#x201d; Lark exclaimed, drop-ping down to retrieve the pins. &#x201c;That woman&#x2019;s a snake! You should hear the things folk around the palace say about her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I bit back a rough answer as I joined her on the floor. I thought she&#x2019;d be dead pleased to hear my news.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, those folk ain&#x2019;t got a cunning like I do, and I know she&#x2019;ll keep her word!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark didn&#x2019;t look convinced. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s she promised you, then?&#x201d; According to Master Iordan, when a king or queen loses the throne, it&#x2019;s usually &#x2019;cause they end up losing something more important&#x2014;like a war. Or, if they&#x2019;re real unlucky, their head. Me and Lady Folque had more&#x2019;n a few things in common&#x2014;we were both cunning. We both wanted what was best for Orstral. And we both thought what was best for Orstral would be if Alphonse Renart wasn&#x2019;t king anymore. But the king didn&#x2019;t have to fear losing his head&#x2014;while my cunning just exposed the lies people told, Lamia&#x2019;s was of a useful sort for our aim. Her cunning, in small doses, could change minds. In large doses, it could be deadly.<br> &nbsp;<br> My fear of the councilwoman had vanished like fog when she told me the story of her elder brother&#x2014;who she begged to save her dog, lost to a raging spring flood when they were whelps. Hit by the full force of her cunning all at once, the boy waded in and was lost, right along with her pet.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s the sort of tale I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve took for made-up, but there was no deceit in it&#x2014;just a woman, sorrowful and guilty over the loss of her brother. Her idea was simple; for the good of the coun-try, she&#x2019;d persuade the king to step down, leaving the throne to his daughter, Saphritte. The princess didn&#x2019;t care for keeping up any sort of quarrel with the Ordish, so the river folk&#x2019;s troubles would soon come to a halt and the indentured whelps would be returned. Orstral would be content again. Lark and Rowan could go home. And, though Lamia Folque didn&#x2019;t know it, so could I. The princess had struck me a bargain&#x2014;when she came to the throne, I&#x2019;d be allowed to return to the orchard. As for the no-gooders trying to make the Ordish look bad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we could get to the bottom of that later.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark sat back on her knees, taking in my tale. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s going to talk the king off the throne? And then just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go home? That don&#x2019;t sound very like her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s leaving her council seat to her daughter. I guess she&#x2019;ll go back to Folquemotte and do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever it is people with coin do in their free time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We got to our feet and Lark helped me out of my nightdress. &#x201c;If she cares about Orstral so much, why can&#x2019;t she just do it herself, without telling anyone else?&#x201d; she grumbled. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s she want with you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Folk&#x2019;ll believe me, that&#x2019;s why!&#x201d; I answered, wriggling into my shift. &#x201c;The princess, the king, the council&#x2014;I mean, I still can&#x2019;t say anything that&#x2019;s untrue, but the truth I do tell&#x2019;s got weight to throw behind her cunning. We&#x2019;ve had no chance for a jaw outside council meetings, but someone slipped this under my door last night.&#x201d; I stuck a hand between my mattress and the board beneath. The thick, cream-colored paper was folded tight, the wax seal with the dancing rabbit broken open. I handed it to Lark as I put on my greatcoat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2018;You are cordially invited for tea and conversation with His Majesty and Lady Folque tomorrow at the fourth afternoon bell,&#x2019;&#x201d; she read, shaking her head. &#x201c;Sounds to me like she&#x2019;s just invited you for a cuppa and cake with the king.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see? She&#x2019;s ready to start trying and she wants me to help! It makes sense, with the wedding coming up and all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yule and the tales of burned grain stores weren&#x2019;t the only things stirring up the city. In two weeks, Saphritte would marry Hauk Eydisson, the second son of King Bram and Queen Arnora of Thorvald. Though the prince and a few minor nobles had been in Bellskeep for months already, the rest of the northern folk would be descending on the city in just a few hours. The fact that Lark&#x2019;d even got a new frock for the occasion told me the palace wasn&#x2019;t sparing any expense for their arrival. I&#x2019;d heard whispers round the castle of Thorvald&#x2019;s fierce warriors and strange cus-toms. Gareth said another steward told him King Bram once wrestled an ice bear and won. Master Iordan sniffed at that rumor, telling me it was &#x201c;truly quite impossible, as an ice bear weighs nearly a ton, stands over six feet on its hind legs, and has claws the size of kitchen knives.&#x201d; The inquisitor was almost always right, but he sure knew how to ruin a good story.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Master Iordan&#x2019;s been making sure I know a bit before the northern court arrives. Go ahead,&#x201d; I bade Lark eagerly as she pulled a large leather belt round my waist. &#x201c;Ask me how to say &#x2018;good morning&#x2019; in Thorvald.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t ready to let go of my deal with Lamia Folque, but she indulged me. &#x201c;All right, how do you say &#x2018;good morning&#x2019; in Thorvald?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Goden morhen,&#x201d; I pronounced carefully. &#x201c;Now ask me how to say &#x2018;good night.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sighed. &#x201c;How do you say &#x2018;good night&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Goda noght. Now ask me how to say, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve got a face like a cat&#x2019;s rear end.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark&#x2019;s fingers fumbled on the belt. &#x201c;Why in Deep&#x2019;s name did Master Iordan teach you that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, All, it wasn&#x2019;t the inquisitor! Prince Hauk said it to one of the fellows at the table and all the Thorvald laughed. The princess would only tell me what it meant if I promised not to repeat it in polite company.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I pulled on my warm fleece leggings and boots just as there was a sharp knock on the chamber door. I&#x2019;d know the sound of those knuckles anywhere.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Goden morhen, Gareth,&#x201d; I called.<br> &nbsp;<br> The steward&#x2019;s freckled face popped round the door. &#x201c;Did that mean &#x2018;come in&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Close enough,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be a second.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lark held up my great golden brooch, shaped like an eye, set with a radiant sapphire. She carefully poked the pin through the lapel of my coat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; she said, quiet-like, so Gareth couldn&#x2019;t hear. &#x201c;Promise me you won&#x2019;t get so wrapped up in your cunning that you forget how to see round the end of your nose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I put one hand over hers. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting out of here. I promise you that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Illustrated Handbook of Vernacular Architecture</h2><p>This is a new edition of the classic illustrated handbook on vernacular architecture, fully updated, with 24 pages of additional illustrations and text.

Building on the principles found in his father's international bestseller (2.5 million copies sold in the US), Don Miguel explores the ways in which we attach ourselves inappropriately to beliefs and the world. This is ancient wisdom for finding your true self. Ruiz explores the five levels of attachment that cause suffering in our lives. The five levels are: * Authentic Self * Preference * Identification * Internalization &gt;* Fanatacism Accessible and practical, The Five Levels of Attachment invites us to look at our own lives and see how an unhealthy level of attachment can keep us trapped in a psychological and spiritual fog. He then teaches us to reclaim our true freedom by cultivating awareness, detaching, and discover our true selves.</p><p>Don Miguel Ruiz Jr. is a Nagual, a Toltec Master of Transformation. He is a direct descendant of the Toltecs of the Eagle Knight lineage and is the son of don Miguel Ruiz.

Ruiz Jr. very simply lays out how our personal belief systems are conditioned from a very early age. We naturally develop preferences and make judgments as well. This book will walk readers through essays to question their own beliefs and look outside the box of their personal attachments. Ruiz Jr. provides simple steps for readers to take action, pausing before jumping to conclusions and giving them permission to experience an alternate story to their conditioned "attachments" that can be applied in any situation.</p><p>The concepts discussed are not new, but Ruiz Jr. brings a fresh, very masculine and straightforward approach to changing thoughts and behavior that will result in powerful spiritual growth."<b>--Allyson Gracie</b>, Wellness Specialist, <i>Retailing Insight</i>, March 2013</p><br><br>"Don Miguel Ruiz Jr., my first son, belongs to a new generation of artists (Toltecs) who are transforming the way of life of our beloved humanity." -<b>don Miguel Ruiz</b>, author of <i>The Four Agreements</i></p><h2>Illustrated Marquis De Sade</h2><p>In 1797 an edition was published of the Marquis de Sade&#39;s &#34;The New Justine&#34; and &#34;The Story of Juliette&#34; with engravings by anonymous artists to illustrate the action of the books.

In a matter of months, society has crumbled: There is no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. Rick Grimes finds himself one of the few survivors in this terrifying future. A couple months ago he was a small town cop who had never fired a shot and only ever saw one dead body. Separated from his family, he must now sort through all the death and confusion to try and find his wife and son. In a world ruled by the dead, we are forced to finally begin living. </li></ul></p><p>Taking a well-worn genre&#x2014;flesh-eating zombies overrun the world and the unlucky surviving humans must deal with the gruesome aftermath&#x2014;and approaching it from a purely character-driven point of view propels this series into the spotlight from out of nowhere. This collection of the first six issues of the ongoing series opens with police officer Rick Grimes awakening from a gunshot-induced coma. From here, he's immediately dragged into a world where dangerous revenants are shambling amok without any sort of an explanation. From the moment Grimes comes to, it's a harrowing battle to avoid hordes of decomposing zombies and a hope-against-all-odds search for his missing family. Grimes makes his way to Atlanta, the nearest large city where there may be other living people, and events take several unexpected turns upon his arrival, as he meets up with a rural encampment of survivors. Of course, as in recent hit movies <i>28 Days Later... </i>and <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, the last humans may turn out to be as much a danger as the zombies. Forceful scripting that gives the book a strong grounding in reality, crisp b&amp;w artwork, a shocking final sequence and brisk, gory proceedings elevate this book from the trash heap of pedestrian horror comics. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book conveniently surveys the lives and works of African American women writers.</p><p></p><p>Included are alphabetically arranged entries on more than 150 African American women novelists, poets, playwrights, short fiction writers, autobiographers, essayists, and influential scholars. Some of these figures, such as Toni Morrison and Gloria Naylor, are among the most popular authors writing today, while others have been largely neglected or are recently emerging. </p><p></p><p>Each entry provides a biography, a discussion of major works, a survey of the writer's critical reception, and primary and secondary bibliographies. The <i>Encyclopedia</i> closes with a selected, general bibliography. Students and general readers will welcome this guide to the rich achievement of African American women. Literature students will value its exploration of the works of these writers, while social studies students will appreciate its examination of the social issues these women confront in their works.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Alphabetically arranged entries discuss the lives, works, and critical reception of more than 150 African American women writers.</p></p><h2>Murders and Metaphors (A Magical Bookshop Mystery)</h2><p><b><i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Amanda Flower is back with the third in her more-charming-than-ever Magical Bookshop mystery.

It begins with the most basic questions: from where and when did the Hebrew Bible originate, how was it written, and how did people read it? In focusing on the fundamental question of the canon--Who are we?--it first gives much attention to the issue of identity. Then it explores how the ancient Israelites organized themselves in terms of power and state, and finally, delineates the larger questions of God and ideology within the canon. The result is a flow of topics that is in line with other studies of ancient literature and culture, without ignoring the religious function of the Hebrew Bible. Through art, photography, literature, and popular culture, this text vibrantly presents the concepts of the Hebrew Bible.</p></p><p><b>Sandra L.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations ï¿½1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Drury shows how to use visionary magic guided imagery and directed dreaming to achieve alternate states of consciousness that are as real as subways and skyscrapers.</p><p>Nevill Drury demonstrates perhaps better than anyone has ever done before that modern Western occult magic sometimes has trance and visionary aspects that are unexpectedly similar to those of classic shamanism.</p><h2>Sefer Ha-aggadah: The Book of Legends for Young Readers</h2><p>A collection of legends about the Jewish people are drawn from stories of the Old Testament</p><p>Grade 4-7. The Sefer Ha-Aggadah is made up of six volumes of legends about the Jewish people. This collection is drawn from the first volume, which focuses on stories from the Bible. The legends follow the Old Testament sequentially, but omit major events, such as Jacob receiving Esau's birthright, to concentrate on the legendary material that has grown out of the Biblical tales. Sometimes a story within a story is told to illustrate a concept or clarify a point. The retellings do not have the humor of Marc Gellman's books, but are clearly and crisply written. Older readers familiar with the basic tales will find this approach effective, but the organization may confuse younger readers.

Henrietta longs to see a few sights in the foreign city; little does she know what fascinating secrets the Fisher house itself contains.<br>For Henrietta finds that her visit coincides with that of Leopold, an intense child who has come to Paris to be introduced to the mother he has never known.

Intending to start a trading business, Blood brings with him rum, supplies, and Sally, a 16-year-old girl he won in a card game from the madam of a brothel. A rugged "man of contradictions," Blood is learned and occasionally kind, yet capable of considerable cruelty and violence. Rumors quickly circulate in Indian Stream regarding his troubled past, and Blood is made a scapegoat when conflicts escalate in the area following his arrival. As Blood's history is gradually revealed, it becomes clear that his only chance at redemption is through confrontation.<p> Demonstrating his gift for narration, Lent has created a rich and entertaining novel from this somewhat familiar outline, filled with well-developed characters and stark, evocative descriptions. In its epic, unflinching style and omniscient voice, Lent's prose is reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy and Faulkner, to whom he is often compared. Wolves, scoundrels, and barbaric natives abound, and Lent never shies away from the gritty, realistic detail appropriate for the novel's harsh setting. Though light on profundities, <i>Lost Nation</i> should offer readers many engaging reasons to return. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>Jeffrey Lent lives in Vermont with his wife and two daughters.

She hated doing this, had sworn she'd never so much as speak to the man again after his last, most devastating rejection. But she'd been left with little choice.<p>With her shoe box tucked beneath her arm and one hand on the wall, offering support, she made her way down the hall to Derek's office. She still felt awkward without her crutches, but she knew better than to show him any weaknesses at all. When she reached the open door, she straightened her shoulders, forced a smile, and tried to make her steps as smooth as possible.</p><p>Derek sat behind his desk, his chair half turned so that he could look out the window at the Saturday morning traffic. The rest of the building, except for the security guards, was empty, just as she'd planned.</p><p>He was still as gorgeous, as physically compelling as ever, only now he looked a little disheveled, a little rumpled. She liked this look better than the urbane businessman he usually portrayed. The only other time she'd seen him relaxed like this was right after he'd made love to her.</p><p>That thought licked a path of heat from her heart to her stomach and back again, and she had to clear her throat.</p><p>His chair jerked around and his gaze pierced her, freezing her on the spot. Even her heartbeat seemed to shudder and die. Only his eyes moved as he looked her over, slowly and in excruciating detail, as if he'd never seen her before and needed to commit her to memory, then their eyes met&#x2014;and locked. For painstaking moments they stayed that way, and the heat, the intensity of his gaze, thawed her clear down to her toes. Her chest heaved as she tried to deal with the unexpected punch of reacting to him again. It shouldn't have happened; she didn't care anymore, wasn't awed by him now. Her infatuation had long since faded away, but seeing him with his straight brown hair hanging over his brow, his shirtsleeves rolled up, made him more human than ever. His gaze seemed brighter, golden like a fox, and she tightened her hold on the shoe box, using it to remind herself of her purpose.</p><p>She saw some indiscernible emotion cross his face, and then he stood. "Angel."</p><p>His voice was low and deep. As he rounded the desk his eyes never left hers, and she felt almost ensnared. She retreated a step, which effectively halted his approach. He lifted one dark eyebrow in a look of confusion.</p><p>Idiot. She didn't want to put him off, to show him her nervousness. That would gain her nothing. She tried a smile, but he didn't react to it. Moving more slowly now, he stepped closer, watching her, waiting.</p><p>"Can I take your coat?"</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying to dispel the fog of emotions that swamped her. When she opened them again, she found him even closer, studying her, scrutinizing her every feature. He lifted a hand and she held her breath, but his fingers only coasted, very gently, over her cheek.</p><p>"You're cold," he said softly. Then he stepped back.</p><p>"Can I pour you a cup of coffee?"</p><p>Angel nodded, relieved at the mundane offer. "Thank you. Coffee sounds wonderful." Walking forward, she set her shoe box on the edge of the desk and slipped out of her coat, aware of his continued glances as he collected two mugs from a tray. She didn't mean to, but she said, "You seem different."</p><p>He paused, then deliberately went back to his task. "Oh? In what way?"</p><p>With one hand resting on the shoe box, she used the other to indicate his clothes. "I've never seen you dressed so casually before. And offering to pour me coffee. Usually you&#x2014;"</p><p>He interrupted, handing her a steaming mug. "Usually I leave domestic tasks to women, I know." He shrugged, gifting her with that beautiful smile of his that could melt ice even on a day like today. "But you insisted no one else be here today, so I was left to my own devices. It was either make the coffee, or do without."</p><p>Angel fidgeted. "You know why I didn't want anyone else here. Your family would have asked questions if they'd seen us together."</p><p>He nodded slowly. "True." Then he asked in a low curious tone, "Why are you here, Angel?"</p><p>Flirting had never come easy to her, but especially not these days. She smiled. "I've missed you, of course. Didn't you miss me just a little?"</p><p>He stared a moment longer, then carefully set his mug aside. "Most definitely," he said. He took her coffee as well, placing it beside his, then cupped her face. Strangely enough, his fingers felt rough rather than smooth, and very hot. He searched her every feature, lingering on her mouth while his thumb wreaked havoc on her bottom lip, smoothing, stroking. "Show me how much you missed me, Angel."</p><p>Now this was the Derek she understood, the man who always put his own pleasures first, the man who had always physically wanted her. That hadn't changed. Without hesitation, surprised at how acceptable the prospect of kissing him seemed when all day she'd been dreading it, she leaned upward. He was much taller than her, and her leg was too weak for tiptoes, so she caught him around the neck and pulled him down.</p><p>When her mouth touched his, tentative and shy, she felt his smile. She kept her eyes tightly closed, mostly because she knew he was watching her and she felt exposed, as if he'd guess her game at any moment. It had been so long since she'd done this, since she'd kissed a man, and she was woefully out of practice and nervous to boot. If necessity hadn't driven her to it, she'd have gone many more months, maybe even years, without touching a man. Especially this man.</p><p>But now she was touching him, and shamefully, to her mind, it was rather enjoyable.</p><p>Tilting her head, she parted her lips just a bit and kissed him again, more enthusiastically this time, nibbling his bottom lip between her teeth. His humor fled and he drew a deep breath through his nose. "Angel?"</p><p>"Kiss me, Derek. It's been so long."</p><p>The errant truth of her words could be heard in the hunger of her tone, something she couldn't quite hide. His answering groan sounded of surprise, almost anger, but kiss her he did. Wow. Angel held on, stunned at the reaction in her body to the dampness, the heat of his mouth as he parted her lips more and thrust his tongue inside. His body, hard and tall and strong, pressed against hers. It had never felt this way, like a storm on the senses. Her heart rapped against her breastbone, her stomach heated, her nipples tightened, and he seemed to be aware of it all, offering soft encouragement every time she made a sound, every time she squirmed against him. She wasn't being kissed, she was being devoured.</p><p>"Damn, Angel."</p><p>"I know," she said, because everything was different, somehow volatile. "I didn't plan on...this."</p><p>He paused, his lips touching her throat, then raised his face to look at her. He said nothing, but his hand lifted and closed over her breast, causing her to suck in her breath on a soft, startled moan. Oh no. She was so sensitive, and she hadn't realized. "Derek..."</p><p>He kissed her again, hard, cutting off her automatic protest, then backed her to the desk. His groin pressed against her, making her aware of his solid erection, of the length and heat of it. Her plans fled; there was no room in her brain for premeditated thought, not when her body suddenly felt so alive again, reacting on pure instinct. His hand smoothed over her bottom, pulling her even closer, rocking her against him. Her leg protested, but she ignored it, an easy thing to do when his scent, his strength, filled her.</p><p>"How long has it been, Angel?"</p><p>She clutched his shoulders, her head back, her eyes closed, as he kneaded her breast with one hand, and kept her pelvis close with the other. Surely he knew as well as she did, so she merely said, "A long time."</p><p>"And you've missed me?" He nibbled her earlobe, then dipped his tongue inside. "Why didn't you call?"</p><p>Even in the sensual fog, she saw the trap. "After the way you acted last time?" She was astounded he would even ask such a thing!</p><p>He hesitated, then asked, "How exactly did you expect me to act?"</p><p>She stiffened as she pulled back. "Not like you couldn't have cared less! And after the way you'd betrayed my trust! You got me fired, you&#x2014;"</p><p>"Shhh." He kissed her again, lingering, and his hand started a leisurely path down her body, measuring her waist, which thankfully was slim again, then roving over her hip. Her thoughts, her anger, turned to mush. She caught her breath with each inch he advanced. His fingers curled on her thigh, bunching her skirt, then moved upward again, this time underneath, touching against her leggings. He cupped her, startling her, shocking her actually. But she didn't move and neither did he. She tried to remind herself that this was what she'd hoped for, but it wasn't true. She'd stupidly hoped for so much more.</p><p>His fingers felt hot even through her clothes, but he was still, just holding her, watching her again. "Why now, Angel? Why this secret arrangement?"</p><p>She decided a partial truth would serve. "There's been no one but you."</p><p>"And you needed a man, so it had to be me?"</p><p>"Yes." That was true, too. She didn't know who to trust, who to fear, so for what she needed, no one else would serve. But she hadn't planned on her own honest participation. Her body reacted independently of her mind; she felt shamed by her response to a man she should have loathed, but overriding that was some inescapable need, swamping her, causing her whole body to tremble. Maybe the pregnancy had altered her hormones or something, but she'd never in her life felt like this, and it was wonderful.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and squeezed her eyes shut. Her body felt tightly strung, waiting, anticipating. She dredged up thoughts of the past, of all the reasons she had to despise him, why his touch could never matter...</p><p>He seemed a bit stunned as she moaned softly and her fingers dug into his upper arms. He held her close, his own breathing harsh while his mouth moved gently on her temple. In all her imaginings, she had never envisioned this scenario, allowing him to touch her there, with her half-l...</p></p><h2>The Collected Works of W.B. Yeats Vol. V: Later Essays</h2><p>Compiling nineteen essays and introductions, a volume with explanatory notes includes Per Amica Silentia Lunae and On the Boiler as well as introductions on Shelley and Balzac and essays on Irish poetry and politics.</p><p>The Collected Works of W. B. Yeats, Volume V: Later Essays is part of a fourteen-volume series overseen by eminent Yeats scholars Richard J. Finneran and George Mills Harper. The series includes virtually all of the Nobel laureate&#39;s published work, with authoritative and explanatory textual notes. The Later Essays brings together for the first time twenty-one essays and introductions that Yeats published after 1912. They include the long essay &#34;Per Amica Silentia Lunae&#34;, in which Yeats first developed his important doctrine of the mask and which is widely admired for the luxuriant beauty of its prose. This definitive edition includes full explanatory notes and provides the first carefully researched, reliable texts of these twenty-one works.William Butler Yeats is generally considered to be Ireland&#x2019;s greatest poet, living or dead, and one of the most important literary figures of the twentieth century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923.</p><h2>The Soul of Christianity: Restoring the Great Tradition</h2><p><p>"I have tried to describe a Christianity which is fully compatible with everything we now know, and to indicate why Christians feel privileged to give their lives to it."<br>&#x2014;Huston Smith</p><p>In his most personal and passionate book on the spiritual life, renowned author, scholar, and teacher of world religions Huston Smith turns to his own life-long religion, Christianity. With stories and personal anecdotes, Smith not only presents the basic beliefs and essential teachings of Christianity, but argues why religious belief matters in today's secular world.</p><p>Though there is a wide variety of contemporary interpretations of Christianity&#x2014;some of them conflicting&#x2014;Smith cuts through these to describe Christianity's "Great Tradition," the common faith of the first millennium of believers, which is the trunk of the tree from which Christianity's many branches, twigs, and leaves have grown. This is not the exclusivist Christianity of strict fundamentalists, nor the liberal, watered-down Christianity practiced by many contemporary churchgoers. In exposing biblical literalism as unworkable as well as enumerating the mistakes of modern secularists, Smith presents the very soul of a real and substantive faith, one still relevant and worth believing in.</p><p>Smith rails against the hijacked Christianity of politicians who exploit it for their own needs. He decries the exercise of business that widens the gap between rich and poor, and fears education has lost its sense of direction. For Smith, the media has become a business that sensationalizes news rather than broadening our understanding, and art and music have become commercial and shocking rather than enlightening. Smith reserves his harshest condemnation, however, for secular modernity, which has stemmed from the misreading of science&#x2014;the mistake of assuming that "absence of evidence" of a scientific nature is "evidence of absence." These mistakes have all but banished faith in transcendence and the Divine from mainstream culture and pushed it to the margins.</p><p>Though the situation is grave, these modern misapprehensions can be corrected, says Smith, by reexamining the great tradition of Christianity's first millennium and reaping the lessons it holds for us today. This fresh examination of the Christian worldview, its history, and its major branches provides the deepest, most authentic vision of Christianity&#x2014;one that is both tolerant and substantial, traditional and relevant.</p></p><p><p>Huston Smith is internationally known and revered as the premier teacher of world religions. He is the focus of a five-part PBS television series with Bill Moyers and has taught at Washington University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley. The recipient of twelve honorary degrees, Smith's fifteen books include his bestselling <em>The World's Religions</em>, <em>Why Religion Matters</em>, and his autobiography, <em>Tales of Wonder</em>. </p>An intriguing combination of apologia, early church history and cultural critique, this deeply personal book attempts to convey the foundations of Christian thought in a way that appeals to modern readers seeking authentic faith in a secular culture. The devotional tone is a distinct departure for Smith, a philosopher and prominent scholar of world religions. This may account for the erudite and occasionally rambling quality of the book's first section, where Smith delineates the "fixed points" of a Christian worldview; he uses science, psychology, the arts, Platonic philosophy and medieval theology to meditate on the nature of reality and the order of the universe. As Smith takes on the "shaky foundation" of modern culture, one of his central tenets is that modern culture has not been able to "distinguish absence-of-evidence from evidence-of-absence." The book's longest section is Smith's summary of the life and significance of Jesus, the history of the early church and various theological matters such as the Trinity and the nature of heaven and hell. While parts are relatively straightforward, Smith's use of anecdotes and willingness to make his own idiosyncratic interpretations of major doctrines of the Christian faith mean that this section cannot be read as a simple digest of previous scholarship. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One is Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote, in Nature, that "The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common."

Nature can help us know ourselves, and at the same time is worth preserving for its own sake, as well as for the values we humans attach to it. </p><p> As we enter the 21st century, the 150-year-old words of these nature lovers are as relevant as ever.

It was the first comprehensive guide ever written for interpretive and hiking trails in provincial parks. As with the first edition, I ask you, the user, to write to me in care of the publisher whenever you discover a flaw in the trail descriptions or would like to share a special trail experience. I also encourage you to write the relevant park superintendent as well to voice your opinions and concerns.

These trails range from those well known and well used in parks such as Algonquin, to little known trails visited by only a few people. They lead you to explore rivers, wateffalls, caves, cliffs, rugged shorelines, forests, bogs and marshes, and traces of our history in abandoned farms, old mines, fire towers and native pictographs. You will become acquainted with the lives and stories of a few of the early settlers, miners, loggers, trappers and the native peoples. You will also be able to add to the pleasure of walking by combining it with other pursuits -- birdwatching, the study of rocks, wildflowers, bogs, ferns, trees and other natural features. Best of all, you will come to know the land better, and increase your sense of connected-ness to it and respect for all that it embraces. </p><p> Most of the nature walks in this book are generally less than two hours long, easy to walk with clearly marked routes. Since the trails are located within provincial parks, parking, toilets, and drinking water can be found either at or near the start of the trail. Descriptions of the trails are based upon information gathered during the summers of 1998 and 1999 and the fall of 2004, either from park staff or during actual trail visits. However, you should be on the alert for possible changes due to human intervention or natural occurrences. </p></p><h2>The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire</h2><p>2011 Fall River Press hardcover, 2nd printing.

The ensuing siege pitted battle-hardened Janissaries wielding seventeenth-century grenades against Habsburg armies, widely feared for their savagery. The walls of Vienna bristled with guns as the besieging Ottoman host launched bombs, fired cannons, and showered the populace with arrows during the battle for Christianity s bulwark. Each side was sustained by the hatred of its age-old enemy, certain that victory would be won by the grace of God.The Great Siege of Vienna is the centerpiece for historian Andrew Wheatcroft s richly drawn portrait of the centuries-long rivalry between the Ottoman and Habsburg empires for control of the European continent. A gripping work by a master historian, The Enemy at the Gate offers a timely examination of an epic clash of civilizations.</p><p><b>Andrew Wheatcroft</b> is Professor of International Publishing and Communication and Director of the Centre for Publishing Studies at the University of Stirling. He is the author of <i>Infidels</i>, <i>The Habsburgs</i>, and <i>The Ottomans</i>, and has been researching the material for <i>The Enemy at the Gate</i> for more than twenty years.

Throughout, he strives to distinguish between the actual siege of Vienna in 1683 and the one preserved in the Western imagination, noting print&#x2019;s power to distort and undervalue the humanity of the Ottoman Turks.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Choice</i></b><br> &#x201c;Wheatcroft&#x2019;s real contribution is his illustration of complex Ottoman administrative and military structures. In fact, the book reveals these to have been a main source of Ottoman power; not, as many have suggested, the provocation of fear through terror or oriental savagery. Wheatcroft also adeptly addresses important historiographical questions about Ottoman decline, the dangers of over-reliance on secondary source materials, syncretism of nomadic steppe tradition with Islamic values, and fine contrasts between Ottoman and European military techniques.&#x201d;<br><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &#x201c;As Andrew Wheatcroft brilliantly shows in <i>The Enemy at the Gate</i>, the skirmishes and the pitched battles that raged for centuries between Habsburgs and Ottomans, and their numerous vassals on both sides, represented not so much a &#x2018;clash of civilizations&#x2019; as a collision of empires....
